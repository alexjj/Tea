I feel like I should be using this time better, but I’m enjoying just sitting and reading my fiction book. Partially as I only normally read at night and if I’m tired I make it through about 2 paragraphs before falling asleep, and so now I can read several chapters all at once! I’m also in the last 10% of the last in the Stormlight series, so everything is coming to a climax.

The company I work for just bought another company. Seems good as it means there’s something more beyond the next 5 years. I did think “oh that means I can just stay here until I retire” so I’ll never do anything else. Which is maybe the easy route - although nothing is actually that easy, there’ll be re-orgs and layoffs so one can’t take anything for granted.

I’ve had an idea for a new website/app. I’ve not bought the domain yet because I worry it’ll turn into another nice idea that I do nothing about. (But what if someone else takes the domain in the mean time) - 😈 It would be a good little project to //actually// learn some JS rather than just sort of reading a book about it.
