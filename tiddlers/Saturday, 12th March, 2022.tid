After seeing an offer on a 5600X, it turned into buying a whole new computer! ðŸ˜…  The hardest part is deciding on getting a new graphics card (or not). My current one, RTX 1060, isn't shabby, plus pricing is insane right now. The best option is getting a founder's edition - which for some reason is sold at RRP - but there's only one store that sells them and they only get a few in stock every couple of weeks. 

I did fret about the motherboard that I bought. Probably best not reading reviews, as generally people only leave reviews if things don't work, and there are likely hundreds which are perfectly fine. Similarly with buying a PSU, there are so many options, it's best not to get bogged down into the details and just pick a known brand at a reasonable price point.

It should all be arriving over the next few days, so I'll be having fun building ... it'll be my first build in just over 10 years! 

I sort of want to install Linux, but given everyone else in the house uses it, I'll probably start with Windows, may even go to 11.
