[[This guy|https://aschmelyun.com/blog/i-built-a-receipt-printer-for-github-issues/]] made a receipt printer output github issues as tickets. I don't need github issues but this is a neat idea for printing things to do, or lists or just stuff that isn't on letter/A4 sized paper....now I want one of those thermal printers...
