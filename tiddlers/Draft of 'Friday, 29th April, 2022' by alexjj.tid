Still want to use micro.blog but I also like the tinkering aspect...

This looks interesting: [[GoBlog|https://goblog.app/]], [[Github|https://github.com/jlelse/GoBlog]], [[Author|https://jlelse.blog/]]

[[Big list|https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/04/cool-things-people-do-with-their-blogs/]] of "cool blogs" that I need to go through.

Eventually I'll be ready to then do [[100 days to offload.|https://100daystooffload.com/]]...yeah right ðŸ˜…

More stuff to look at....[[a webring|https://webring.xxiivv.com/]] or [[two|https://fediring.net/]].

I've got some ideas for a new static blog (including moving daily notes to it). I still like writing in here and thought that I could query the server, get [[all the posts as a JSON|Query Tiddlywiki via API]], then feed that into Hugo. Which I can. However, tiddlywiki syntax is different to markdown. So links and other things won't work. Probably there's a [[conversion tool someone|https://github.com/achabotl/tiddly2md/blob/master/tiddly2md.py]] has made, or I could make one but now things are getting complicated.

So now I'm not sure what to do. I partially just want to start making the hugo site anyway but trying to decide if I want daily notes in it or not. Really want a workflow from my phone though...I saw someone made a Shortcuts that posted their text to AWS lambda that then did some processing of it and added to their blog. That's quite a neat idea, although complex. Most others seem to use working copy iOS app. 

Think I should go for Hugo not jekyll as hugo is being developed more
