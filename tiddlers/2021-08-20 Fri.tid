Trying out [[photoprism|https://photoprism.app/]] on my server. I tried it before but it wouldnâ€™t work, anyway it was simple to get going using docker compose. Only the preview version does face detection but itâ€™s coming to the main one soon enough. Not sure if Iâ€™d want this public facing or just leave it at home, locally. The labelling seems a little poor accuracy wise  - e.g. calling a cow a bird or a person a kite and other random things - but maybe it gets better? It's not google photos smart but they also don't have the resources of google. I do like how there's a mobile app that can sync with it via ~WebDAV, that might be good if I get it up and running, because then photoprism will automatically organise those files. 

Was funny [[finding out|https://micro.blog/twelvety/11840157]] someone is actually reading this site! Hello [[Phil|Phil Nunnally]]! I had a brief panic of "//what did I write on there that he might've seen//" but I know he understands, and I admit I read his wiki too ðŸ˜… [[Phil's |https://youneedastereo.com/]] and [[Jack's|https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/]] are my favourites. So [[HP Tango]] is for you Phil!

Slowly setting up my "proper" [[blog|https://blog.alexjj.com]]. Moved micro.blog to [[micro.alexjj.com|http://micro.alexjj.com]] as well. Here's a list of all the blog posts I've thought about writing but never did:

* A real one about the HP Tango
* One for every camera I've owned and what I've thought about it. Particularly the random film ones I've bought, fixed (well cleaned so they work again) and sold on eBay.
* Reflecting on 10 years on Github. Most stars and interactions I've had, notable moments etc.
* Reflecting on 10 years of having a domain and website - thinking screenshots of old versions of the site etc.
* Going back even further to my very first websites I made as a teenager
* A post about all the mechanical keyboards I've owned, built and sold. 
** I did start this on the old blog, think there was about 15 posts I started drafting for it
* Plain text accounting
** Someone emailed me about my 2016 blog post on beancount the other week! Guess I should put it back online
* Monte Carlo simulations with python for work ðŸ¤“
* Scanning, making a book and website for my [[grandad's|https://grandad.alex.pics/]] 1960s slide film from Africa and places.
* Many more I've since forgotten.

Excited for [[Amazon's Wheel of Time|https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/we-have-our-first-look-at-images-from-amazons-new-wheel-of-time-series/]] TV show. Took me about 5 years to read all those books, and I kept telling people they should make it a TV show. Although if you thought Game of Thrones was long...

[[Diablo II: Resurrected open beta starts today!|https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo2/23688836/play-diablo-ii-resurrected-during-the-early-access-and-open-beta]] Preparing us all to pay Â£40 for a 21 year old game that has been brushed down and tarted up a bit. I'll give it a shot but if I remember correctly, D2 makes D3 seem like a once through story completion game when it comes to grinding gear.
