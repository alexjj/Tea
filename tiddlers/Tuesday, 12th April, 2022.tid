Bought that domain. Letâ€™s see if I actually follow through on my ideaâ€¦

Keep imagining the perfect home site with content and various sections, things like weekly lookbacks and links of interest, reviews of stuffâ€¦all sorts of things that Iâ€™ll never write about.

I looked at my static site this morning, I do like it, writing here is quick and easy but the static site looks nicer to read. I could export content from here to it, I might try it and see how that goes. That way I can just write here but it gets migrated across. Images might be tricky, and links, and â€¦.everything except text so maybe thatâ€™ll be a bit of a chore. Which reminded me why I thought Iâ€™d go back to a weekly summary post on the main site. Things like interesting links I found, a summary of what Iâ€™ve been doing? Althoughâ€¦who caresâ€¦ðŸ˜… It would just give it regular content so it doesnâ€™t look dead.

Given up on getting a new GPU. Donâ€™t really need it and rather spend the money elsewhere. Perhaps this time next year theyâ€™ll be more reasonable and Iâ€™ll think about it again.
