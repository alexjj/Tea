This weekend seemed to pass quickly. Sunday night and I’m reminded of those slides from work. However, I’m not going to do them because that would be sad. Plus I’m into the final 20% of Black Mesa (Half-life 1) which I want to keep playing.

Actually took some film photos this weekend. Just one roll of FP4. Probably quite a few of the images are all the same. Did make me wonder what using a digital rangefinder would be like. Part of the slowness of film is only have a few frames, and the manual focusing. With “unlimited” frames is the digital rangefinder still slow? Seems like it would be a different experience than a film M. 

Someone at work, who I consider to be very intelligent, buys lottery tickets on a regular basis. The odds do increase infinitely from having no ticket to having one ticket but then to actually win, it’s so remote, so very remote. Although I can see that it’s a small amount - a coffee, or a cake etc. - purchased each week that why wouldn’t you? Saving or investing that amount instead would yield basically nothing. Still might win a £1000 or something. Maybe I should 😅 If I won £5K no prizes for guessing what I’d be ordering.

Actually considering getting the Fuji 50mm f/2 again. It seems unlikely I’ll buy anything else, and that would be useful either way. The f/1.2 would be nice but big. 

Turns out I have £2.30 in my lottery account, and tomorrow is the set for life draw. £10k per month for 30 years is the headline prize. Also lottery winnings are tax free in the UK 🤑

We’ve all been playing a board game that my daughter got for her birthday - [[Zombie Teens Evolution|https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/310448/zombie-teenz-evolution]]. It’s pretty good, and everyone loves playing it. It’s a co-operative game to collect all the crates without the zombies taking over. The neat part is that there are a series of envelopes with extra cards, characters, abilities, etc. that you get to add to the game as you play it more.
