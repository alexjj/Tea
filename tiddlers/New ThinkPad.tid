title: New ThinkPad
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

I think I want a ThinkPad ðŸ˜… I like mac but prefer linux, also I donâ€™t want to spend mac prices. This will be myâ€¦6th (or 8th depending if you include rpis) computer in the houseâ€¦so I donâ€™t want to spend much more than I need to.

Thinking 8th gen intel CPU or higher, that way it has the new low power quad cores for a bit more processing power. Means T490 orâ€¦not figured out which X1 Carbon yet. Iâ€™m guessing the T490 will be cheapest but not checked yet.
