I want to buy a Concept 2 rowing machine. Stock must be sorted out now as Amazon has them for immediate delivery. I just worry itâ€™ll end up like the bike trainer. A nice garage ornament. Part of the issue with bike trainer is/was the software. Couldnâ€™t find any decent free system to set a training schedule and then show the numbers about it. I tried Zwift for a while but so much of it I didnâ€™t care about and it seemed like basic things were missing. Like how much left of my route is there or all of the graphics. I liked the variation in difficultly but wouldnâ€™t pay attention to the screen and just listen to podcasts. Felt it wasnâ€™t worth the Â£15/month. 

The rower is different as it comes with the PM5 controller which you can set training things and it shows a countdown etc. Plus itâ€™s a more balanced training vs predominantly legs. 

Itâ€™s just quite pricey and I worry Iâ€™ll not actually use it. 

argh...daily notes/blogs/etc. ðŸ˜µ
