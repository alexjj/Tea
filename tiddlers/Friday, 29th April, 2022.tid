Still want to use micro.blog but I also like the tinkering aspect...

This looks interesting: [[GoBlog|https://goblog.app/]], [[Github|https://github.com/jlelse/GoBlog]], [[Author|https://jlelse.blog/]]

[[Big list|https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/04/cool-things-people-do-with-their-blogs/]] of "cool blogs" that I need to go through.

Eventually I'll be ready to then do [[100 days to offload.|https://100daystooffload.com/]]...yeah right ðŸ˜…

More stuff to look at....[[a webring|https://webring.xxiivv.com/]] or [[two|https://fediring.net/]].
