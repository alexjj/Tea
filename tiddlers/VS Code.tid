As much as I like the ideal of vim and emacs I think I should skip learning them and stick to something like VS Code. Iâ€™ve used pycharm but I think VS Code is a better option for my aspirations of learning JavaScript as well as python. 

I should take some time to master it or at least configure it and start learning it.
