Iâ€™m amazed how I was super motivated to do this site last night. I do like it, and I much prefer having a static generated site than anything else. Now it feels like a bit of a slog to do the remaining parts. Iâ€™m now in that 20% which is going to take 80% of the time! I should make a list of the things I want to complete or figure out:

Maybe a hidden dedicated page for my reference?


  Figure out all the CSS elements and how I add them. e.g. markdown, or includes, or get jekyll to render them
    
      That is quite a big oneâ€¦ ðŸ˜… Main ones:
      Full width images
      Aside images
      Asides
      Description lists
      Quotes
      Code and syntax highlighting
    
  
  Install syntax highlighting - either jeykll or js plugins
  Add comments (maybe use utterances on github?) and hide them with &lt;details&gt; section
  Change header links on main page. Either remove underline or some fancy ::before thing.
  Maybe a gallery plugin like fotorama.io
  Image zoom plugin
  favicon etc. plus &lt;head&gt; things for it all.


Those are probably the essentials or the first round to sort out. Other stuff Iâ€™m thinking of:


    Adding content
    Do I keep using journal.txt? It's simple to enter stuff and I don't have to remember anything. I've hacked the page titles so I ignore them. If I want to do anything further then might need to go. VS Code and Prose.io are the obvious other things to investigate, with plugins/configs etc.


Random stuff:


  General style tweaks
  th/st in dates
  tags for daily posts?


Future:


  Collection for blog posts
  ?


Testing page

Use an include for asides.
