Now I want a Leica CL (digital version). Sigh. So many reasons suddenly appear in my head that makes it seem like the best idea I have. It's not much different from my X-T2, aside from a big price difference. It is a nice size but the lenses get big quickly.  The 23 mm f/2, 35 mm f/1.4 and 60 mm f/2.8 macro. Can mount M lenses on it but then can also do that on the Fuji. Maybe I'll get the X100F fixed, sell it and then consider my options.
