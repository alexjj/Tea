Itâ€™s blowing a gale and I canâ€™t sleep. Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll feel terrible later. 

Dave has made a [[standalone pages thing for drummer|https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/105]]. Itâ€™s nice, and was something I had been looking at myself, specifically the this.how implementation. However, itâ€™s not what I was hoping for with Drummer. I wanted a standalone page that matched the theme of the drummer blog. Also itâ€™s not my domain etc. handy for a quick page you want to throw up. Andyâ€™s script is better as I can use a version of the template to match the blog.  

Managed to add exif to all my film scans, now just the albums to catch up on. Only about 15 monthsâ€¦ðŸ¥²

Been wondering if I should migrate the family journal from DayOne to a Tiddlywiki file. Feels like a better solution but maybe itâ€™s too complex. 

Also saw the 5 year journal notebook that looked nice. Has a page per day and 1/5th of the page for each year to write a little. The physical aspect is nice and not sure how Iâ€™d print TW but itâ€™s all json so probably could be done. 

Drummer has a nice interface for writing blog posts. Even though I could, I donâ€™t want to use it for anything else. Not sure if thatâ€™s just because I only associate it with blogging or the editor is still a bit annoying. OR itâ€™s that I donâ€™t actually write much down on the computer. I donâ€™t have notes on the computer. I have some on my phone in Apple Notes for lists on the go, I have this wiki, I have dynalist - although thatâ€™s quite bare, mostly for me sharing lists with other people - and anything at work tends to just get written in my paper notebook. 

I have an iPad and an iPhone, surely I should just get a mac and enjoy my data across all devices. Apple Notes has a lot of features for a seemingly benign notes app. I could probably dump dynalist and any other private note stuff and just use that. Iâ€™ve not even looked into note sharing but thatâ€™s probably useful. 

Quite liking the idea of a family tiddlywiki. For journals and just useful stuff for everyone to remember/access. I suspect only I will ever use it thoughâ€¦I wonder if I can configure nginx to only put a password if accessed outside of our network. Then I could host the node.js version at home but make it accessible remotely via htpasswd.
