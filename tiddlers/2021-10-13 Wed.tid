Turns out you canâ€™t print labels from Royal Mail at the Post Officeâ€¦ðŸ™ƒ

I was going to print at home but as I was sending the camera by Special Delivery I thought Iâ€™d rather have the nice Silver label from the post office. A dumb reason that caused me a bit of panic until I realised I could just buy nee postage there and then and request a refund for the online postage. 

Iâ€™m not sure about the Ricoh anymore. The new model seems too expensive, which leads me to the old modelâ€¦

I should try 28mm (full frame), been seeing lots of occurrences of people liking that focal length. I feel like itâ€™s too wide, but I think Iâ€™ve never used that length as never had a lens for it. Probably closest is my 16-80mm Fuji or back in the day 18-55 or 18-200mm Nikon DX lenses. I used to love 200mm portraits. Now I like 23mm ones! 

Trying to be patient with my developed films...I paid the invoice at 3:30pm but they didn't send the scans and I'm guessing I'll have to wait until tomorrow now.

This guy is awesome:
