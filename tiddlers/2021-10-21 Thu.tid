Now I want a GR again after seeing [[Philâ€™s post|https://youneedastereo.com/#2021-10-20%20Journal]]. My Fuji simulation testing got side tracked by fiddling (and perhaps too much) with Drummer yesterday. The XT2 was still connected to the computer to use the raw converter so I picked up the M2 for shots of the kids making Halloweâ€™en biscuits. Still very enjoyable to use, and Iâ€™m getting used to the light meter on top. Iâ€™ve got it set to full stop increments and thatâ€™s much more convenient to use, as I can interpolate if I want a bit more in either direction.

[[Dave started|https://github.com/alexjj/drummer-blog/issues/2]] a conversation with me yesterday. 

[[Scott Hanson|http://oldschool.scripting.com/ScottHansonDE/2021/10/21/100522.html?title=connectingDrummerToGatsby]] has linked Gatsby to Drummer. 

Iâ€™m not sure why but I was wondering if thereâ€™s a way to find all drummer users.

Daveâ€™s opening up an [[option for RFCs on Drummer.|https://github.com/scripting/drummerRFC/blob/main/README.md]], Iâ€™ll let someone else go first ðŸ˜… I read RFC like feature request, with proposal, justification etc. 

Haha, [[well done Phil|http://oldschool.scripting.com/twelvety/]]. (Un?)fortunately it now means we all have to read two sites per person. Of course drummer offers RSS (or even [[instant oulines!|http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/instantOutlines.opml]]) so that might help. 

Which reminds me that I was looking at RSS readers today. I used to use one all the time (ahem Google Reader) back in the day. Then moved to Feedly then I think twitter and social media took over so I stopped with RSS. //Then// I decided it was all a giant waste of my time and pretty much purged everything. I think I might go back to RSS with a few select sites that I do enjoy reading or visiting frequently...whatever Firefox has up in a blank tab...because that'll be more efficient than opening sites...So back to looking at RSS readers ([[self-hosted only please|https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#feed-readers]]). [[Miniflux|https://miniflux.app/]] looks nice and simple. Or maybe I should go [[extreme with my own archive|https://archivebox.io/]] of all y'alls crap.
