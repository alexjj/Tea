It's [[national take a meter reading day|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60938730]]. Not because of some patron saint or trying to encourage good habits but because most of everyone is about to suffer horrendous energy price increases. Supermarkets have reported fewer root vegetables are being sold as people don't want to use the gas to boil them. At least it's April tomorrow and maybe it'll just be an April Fools'...but if nothing else the weather should be getting slowly milder. It just delays people deciding between food and heat. I'm grateful that whilst the extra cost is horrible, it doesn't make us have to make difficult decisions. 

The thing with prices going up "for temporary reasons" is that they never really seem to ever go back to where they were.

It's annoying enough that Amazon Prime Videos isn't releasing Picard Season 2 in a single lump, but that the whole world has to wait for 6 pm PDT is frustrating. Maybe I should watch Voyager until all the rest of Picard is out.

I never did anything with my home site...or that wordpress blog I made.
