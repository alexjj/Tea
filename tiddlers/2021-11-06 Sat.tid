Iâ€™m not sure about my family photo site hosting arrangement / software. Currently itâ€™s piwigo hosted instance, and previously it was a [[static gen gallery|https://git.zx2c4.com/PhotoFloat/about/]]. Piwigo is a nice app, and the hosting is unlimited storage, so I donâ€™t have to worry about anything for â‚¬39/year. This was pretty much the main reason I bought it. Plus it has decent iOS apps (although Iâ€™ve probably only uploaded about 2 photos using it). It also has comments and a bunch of other features. 

Itâ€™s a lot easier than the static gen but Iâ€™m not sure I like the piwigo gallery style. Iâ€™ve tried to turn everything off in the settings. I just miss the simplicity of the static gallery for viewing. 

Maybe I should simplify my album organisation and just do a new one per set of photos and not bother with any other organisation. I suppose the rest of piwigo should do that for me...caledar view and there's always tagging. 

The displaying of EXIF in piwigo isn't that good - or at least I can't figure out how to make it good. Always seems to display stuff I don't care about. The static site version was much nicer. This also reminds me to get round to adding exif to the film scans. Ugh so many things to do.

As much as I like the idea of vim and emacs, I still just open up VS Code when I want to write some code as I can just do it, and all the buttons and menus mean I don't need to remember stuff. I'm not doing this every day, it's not part of my work, there's so many more things I can do than learn some abstract editor. I can edit config files in the terminal with vim and that's sufficient. It's a little like linux vs macos. Although I have to say once linux is installed there's nothing else to do except update and install new software. Particularly as I've resigned myself to just using GNOME as //it just works//â„¢. Yes i3 and bspwm look cool on /r/unixporn but it's hours and hours of faffing and then remembering more keyboard shortcuts to do anything.  

I rebuild my old photos website using [[photofloat|https://github.com/alexjj/photofloat]], and I do like it...ðŸ¤” 

Remembered I have a cheap VPS with Virmach doing nothing. I used to use it to host my photos static site. Was an ideal VPS for it - $4/''year'', 384 MB RAM but 20GB of storage. Hosting a single static site with nginx it needs zero resources but all the photos take up space. I could've not include the higher res photos and only needed ~3GB for all the small resized images but sometimes people want to download a the original - it's still smaller than the actual original from my camera, I used to use `mogrify` to compress the jpgs to about 3MB.  

Anyway, I wiped it and reinstalled Debian. The ~SolusVM manager only had up to Debian 9 image, so I installed and then updated through buster (10) and and onto bullseye (11). Maybe I could've skipped but thought I'd do it this way to save any unexpected issues. 

I then setup `ufw`, `nginx` and started uploading my old static photo album generated with a fresh copy of [[PhotoFloat]]. That'll take a while as it's 14GB of photos. It always gives me joy the ease at which SSL is setup nowadays. The let's encrypt script just does it all, I don't even need to edit nginx config anymore.

Exploding the Piwigo photo site albums out of years into just straight albums has been a good start. I had made a dedicated film album where I kept albums of cameras and film stocks, this now doesn't work very well. So I need to insert these images into other albums or new ones. I'm tempted to tag the film stock but not bothered about the camera. I should sort out the EXIF data and then it'll be covered...maybe I should do EXIF first, then upload them to the right location and then delete the old films album. 

Piwigo is nice and the unlimited space is useful but I like the simplicity of the other gallery. Also my wife said she preferred the older one, so think I'm going to migrate back to that. I could keep the piwigo as a backup of all photos. The java auto uploader would make backing up everything easy. I'm sure I can password protect it as well. Might try that I think. So I'll be on the lookout for a good VPS this baclk friday to host everything, ideally in UK as that's where we all are, 50GB of space and whatever everything else, for ~Â£10/year would be ideal. I think that should be doable. It's one static site that has about 5 real users.
