Oracle Cloud VPS, where this site is hosted, on a free tier ARM server, had some issue that meant my IP was lost and I had to assign a new one. Being a complex cloud provider this isn’t an obvious task. Eventually found it under the virtual NIC settings. Also meant I had to update the DNS and my SSH config before I could log in and restart nodejs. 😮‍💨 

Back now… makes me think about setting up the static generation and hosting on a CDN, and keeping the hosted node js version just for me to add stuff to. I’ll add it to my list of things to do once our holidays finish. 

Found a new family member who enjoys film photography and owns a lot of nice cameras and development and printing equipment. Just a shame they live in France 🇫🇷.

I don’t need a [[New ThinkPad]] but they’re such good value (used ones of course) that it’s not really a hard decision. It’s funny how new ThinkPads are incredibly expensive yet used ones are by far some of the best models to buy. The only time I’d consider buying a new ThinkPad is cyber Monday when they often offer 50% off. The only new one I want is the X1 Nano but otherwise anything in the last 4-ish years is great. Older is fine too but the screens haven’t been great on older models.
