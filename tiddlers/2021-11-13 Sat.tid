I like software that has sensible defaults. I was listening to JS Party podcast and it was their 200th episode and they were recounting memories of previous episodes. One clip was one of the presenters saying he didnâ€™t think it was worthwhile futzing with dotfiles and customising everything. Itâ€™s just a waste of time, or spend 6 hours to optimise 60 seconds. 

Iâ€™ve been listening to podcasts whilst cycling and itâ€™s great for passing the time on my commute but itâ€™s not very good for capturing information I want to keep from it. Usually the podcast has a website with links and things on it that I can refer to later but I generally forget until the next time I start listening and then remember I wanted to save something. I guess voice memos or something would be the way to go. 

I want to setup the sections of dokuwiki tonight, and was wondering how to use it between this and that. [[Dokuwiki]] does have some blog plugins to make a blog but Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s a nice as TW for the daily journal. But the private/public split is convenient. As I write this I know itâ€™s me sidestepping the real and best answerâ€¦run TW on node.js with access control for me and then have it generate static pages removing private tag files for my public view.   I guess Iâ€™m not sure it is the best answer. 

Maybe I could host Ghost for writing but then [[generate a static|https://github.com/Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator]] version of it for the world. Or [[even this method.|https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/sourcing-from-ghost/]]

I could run my own [[calendar and contacts and then sync them in git|https://radicale.org/3.0.html#tutorials/versioning-with-git]]...interesting...

[[Bulletnotes.io|https://bulletnotes.io/]] sounded cool (Workflowy / Dynalist clone with Kanban (Trello) and Calendar functionality. Organize everything.), but then I used it ðŸ¤® ([[Source|https://gitlab.com/NickBusey/BulletNotes]])
