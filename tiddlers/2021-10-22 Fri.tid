My long term plan is to take all the good parts of drummer and move elsewhere. It won’t be easy (particularly the same level of frictionless writing) and I don’t have a clear plan right now. Feels a little like living back at your parents in your thirties after living away yourself. (Thankfully something I’ve not had to do). Generally everything is fine, they don’t quite have all the things you want but it’s very comfortable so you can manage. They say you can help but clearly only within the rules they define, which they did share but turns out can be interpreted differently. Once you tried to upgrade their WiFi with new AP (that you bought) but somehow that was wrong and everyone shouted and the AP was promptly sent back so we returned to using the ISP’s one. The next day they ask for help with a spreadsheet and you do so and they’re very grateful and say how lovely it is to spend time with you. The whole time you’re waiting for those egg shells you’re walking on to shatter. Whilst you are living in their house, you have a separate entrance and it is possible not to interact. This seems a shame but perhaps turns out for the best. You could sacrifice some convenience and move elsewhere but most of the time it’s fine so you stay. In the back of your mind you know it can’t last forever so should start making plans.

Perception is reality. Is ignorance bliss? 

That new Voigtlander 90mm looks very nice. I was trying to find a decent Leica 90mm, I was being very particularly about wanting [[this specific version|https://www.l-camera-forum.com/leica-wiki.en/index.php/90mm_f/2.8_Tele-Elmarit-M]]. It’s not too common and I lost out on a couple of auctions and all the stores/buy it now options seem too expensive. (Perhaps as I’ve never bought a Leica lens I don’t understand pricing). There’s plenty in Europe and worldwide but would have to pay customs. The CV 90mm f/2.8 is also very small - that was why I wanted that particular version, small and light - but will be more expensive than the Leica as brand new. However, the convenience of buy it now! Also comes in Silver. $800 in US, wonder what the price will be here, probably £750. It’s funny as I was looking at 50mms and decided the CV was a good option! Everyone says (and I want to too) you don’t buy a Leica without trying their lenses. They’re just so expensive and I’m not sure I can tell the difference between lenses that isn’t just the difference in how people compose the scene and post-processing. Maybe a few more Leica’s will show up to tempt me…

Also I’m not sure 90mm is the right lens to get. Anyway, time to get the kids breakfast ready. 

Took the girls cycling in the forest this morning and the light was lovely. Low sun, clear skies, streaming through the trees with autumn colours. If only I had an APS-C compact camera with me…

What a busy day! Too tired to even look at things to buy! Although think I’ve lost my Voigtlander lens cap. 

No one can fork drummer (the website we visit to make outlines) as the code isn’t released? I hope someone can correct me. I remember looking for the a little outliner code and couldn’t find it. I don’t quite follow all of Dave’s software. For example what is concord and where does that fit in?

Emojis for tags. Why didn’t I think of that. 🧠

Tonight I feel like I have lots of things to say but only a terrible iPhone keyboard to say it. There’s lots of random things buzzing about in my head:

* I wish I knew emacs well, as it could be the comfiest, relaxing and calming place to be. Then I could ignore everything else. 
** Truth is, I used it (spacemacs) for a while about 5-6 years ago to manage my ledger. I could do the 3 things I needed and nothing else and was overwhelmed. 
** I like vim more as an editor. But again, be good if I knew it more. 
*** I don’t use it for my work so I’ll never learn it. 
** Probably going to install it again soon…🙌
* I have lots of good intentions but never do anything. 
* websites, computers, software, hardware. They consume my thoughts. Heaven forbid I’m in a social situation and need to talk. 
* why does everyone want old stuff? It’s vintage? I guess, why do I want it…
** what should I buy now that’ll be vintage later?
*** A MP 🎞

I started asking myself why do I like drummer so much. Really there’s two parts:

# Writing content
## Effortless. Click +, and type. Click build. 
## Outliner => headings, titles etc without having to do it.
## keyboard shortcuts for text adjustments 
## opml format. It could be json. Something structured is good. 
# Reading content
## Nice css. I mean it’s all just css, but…I like the white page on grey background. Like dynalist. 
## Links to each “block”
## clear, clean and simple. 
## images generally look good

The other stuff is cool but I’m not bothered about it. 

The CSS is easy to copy. The static generator is pretty doable in a basic form. Heck opml can style itself with a style sheet directly. The urls per block is about the hardest part. The editor is hardest. 

Now is drummer good because it really is, or because: 

* it’s new
* I’ve realised I don’t need to write 5,000 word blog posts. 
* The past couple of months on TW has helped build my habit. 

Probably a bit of both.
