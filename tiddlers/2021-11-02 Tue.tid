I'm meant to be reading my js book, well I am but on page xxxiv of the intro chapter. Actually, I'm tired and maybe will just watch Foundation instead. I didn't like it at the start as it's so different from the books, but now I'm enjoying it and have accepted that it's allowed to be different.


Thought I'd join the smart kids with a [[Conversation]] tag.
