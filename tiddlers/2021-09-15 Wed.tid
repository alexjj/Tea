Spent a while configuring mstmp on the ikiwiki server so that it can send emails for people to “log in” to comment - bit like micro.blog login. However, I then found out how to configure the anonymous comments option so there’s that. At the moment it does let people register although they can’t edit anything…I think…😅

I want to tweak the CSS so images are a bit better, and the margins of some elements are not what I’d chose, but mostly it’s fine. Not sure about the sidebar thing, it’s a bit odd. Anyway it’s fine to use, although I do miss a few of tiddlywiki’s features but as a blog it’s more “normal” for people to read :D

Still have a little concern over splitting my efforts between the two sites. I’ll see how it goes.

My light meter finally arrived, first impressions (prior to using it) are [[here!|https://blog.alexjj.com/posts/Hedeco_Lime_One_Light_Meter_First_Impressions/]]
