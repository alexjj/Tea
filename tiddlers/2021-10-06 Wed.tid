A few newer reviews of the GRiiix, including dpreview. Although after 3 videos the summary of them all is "do you like 40mm ~FoV? Yes get GRiiix; No get GRiii".

Whilst watching the video I go "used GRiii; oh no 3x; 3; 3x; 3...". At least the 40mm lens appears to be good quality.

Fired out an offer to eBay watchers. Someone was interested but low-balled me. I'm not in a great rush but be nice to be done with it. School holidays coming up, I wonder if I should buy the GR(whatever model) ready for it so then I'll have lots to use it with. ü§î

Emailed [[Analogue Wonderlab]] to ask them to list the resolution next to the scan options - they said they would! üëç
