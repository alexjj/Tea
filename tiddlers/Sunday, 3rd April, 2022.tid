Been playing [[Dark Forest]]. The logo looks like Dwarf Fortress. I've just started my own universe with a friend whilst the main game is in limbo until the next round starts (assuming I get an entry). Mostly just want to see how it works and understand what all the fuss is about. 

I do like it. There's not too many rules, but there's a lot of strategy involved. I like the time-basd nature of it, and I can see why people enjoy it. I like that there's no play to win, pay to win, or any monetary association with it. It's like software on Linux - people made it because they could, not necessarily because there was a need. But it's nice that it's open soruce, and you can add plugins via jacvascript (which other people share). There's a nice community to it, having fun, competing but working together.
