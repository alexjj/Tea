You’re a lazy git.

The best sales this Black Friday are always VPS! Lowendbox and lowendtalk have the best deals. The problem is there’s so many it’s hard to know what to get. Often things are limited availability so you have to commit before seeing what else there is. Last few years I’ve bought from inception hosting, they’ve always been reliable and decent, so tempted to upgrade my current VPS to their latest €15/year VPS and be done with it. I’d get more storage and bandwidth for the same price. If I buy it now, it gives me a little bit of time to transfer my services across before the existing one shuts down.
