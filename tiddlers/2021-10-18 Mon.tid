Writing here is much nicer (than drummer) on my phone. I don’t often use my phone but it’s occasionally enough that it’s important. Today we have wife’s sister staying and she’s working in the office so not getting on the computer. 

We went to Dobbies this morning. It’s a garden centre cum everything store. Has a nice aquarium which provides plenty of entertainment. I like looking at the huge koi carp 🎏.

I’m waiting to see what Apple announce today, if it’s a new Mac mini then I may buy one (what commitment!). Although will men’s previous ones will be cheap (as is always the way) but often only the base spec goes on sale. 256GB storage is “okay” but will need an external drive. Perhaps one of those dock base things that can house a nvme and ports etc. 

I would like to be better at our family journal. Technically it can be in anything but I like DayOne. Particularly if I ever want/get anyone else to write it in. The app reminds me every day to make an entry but by that time I’m on the computer and it’s a distraction and I’m not going to start typing on my phone. Maybe iPad but even then probably not. I should encourage the kids to write in it. Shame we don’t have a good spot in the kitchen for an iMac. 

[[Phil Nunnally]] has been doing plenty of searching into Fuji and image processing. I remember doing all that when I got the X100F. Reminds me I want to redo the film simulation presets I have in XT2. I only use 2-3 of the existing ones and one I don’t like that much! It’s annoying you can save white balance settings as part of the custom setting. People usually name theirs 3R-2B to remind them what to set. I want to minimise how much I spend processing them on the computer so if I can get the images good enough in camera then I’ll be happy. 

Having said that, I’d like to try out Capture One. 

Keep waiting for [[Jack’s|Jack Baty]] Q2 to show up more 😅

Tiddlywiki is winning in my mind for daily notes. The extra functionality of Drummer outliner isn't quite as useful as I thought it might be. I think I'd rather just use dynalist if I want an outliner for notes, particularly as it has nice iOS apps. OPML is a nice format and wondering if I could use it somewhere. I may use drummer in place of my [[blog|https://blog.alexjj.com]], although not sure what a big entry would look like...maybe I'll try it now. 

I still haven't looked into film development chemicals yet.
