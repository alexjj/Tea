Not come across this site before it seems like a sane place to get opinions.

Itâ€™s taken me several months to realise that if I paste a URL in VS Code whilst highlighting some text, it makes it a markdown link automatically ðŸ˜… Perhaps I should learn more about it as itâ€™s become my main tool for writing this site.

I am wondering about switching to textile instead of markdown. Mostly so I can use paragraph formatting and add custom ids without a song and dance (Tinderbox ðŸ˜™). If I want one I can just write p(#id). If I donâ€™t then just leave it blank and the default is a paragraph. Does mean I have to come up with the id name. Does also allow for more customisation of individual blocks with styles. Not sure if I really need that though, or just think I need it.
