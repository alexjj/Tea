What is this song about? 😵‍💫

Most of the new computer parts have arrived. Just waiting on the CPU, which should hopefully come next couple of days. I've got some old Windows keys from previous laptops. I wonder if any of them will activate Windows 10...If none of them do, then do I transfer my existing computer's key or buy another? Really don't want to buy Windows. I can't even remember the last time I did. Perhaps Windows 7? Think I got that from student discount at university. I guess I can install Linux on the old computer...although not sure what that's going to be used for. Supposedly saved for the kids but they're not going to want to play on it for several years I think, and there's nowhere for it to go at the moment. Apart from the graphics card, it's worthless though, so might as well keep it for spare. Even if it just sits in the loft for a while. 

I've one solitary colour film, Fujicolor 100, from about 2 weeks ago waiting to be developed. Maybe I should just send it off on its own. 

That M10-P I was debating about has gone from eBay. I think the seller cancelled the listing as eBay says it was taken down due to an error, perhaps he realised it was significantly cheaper than all the other listings? I was close to getting it....well I tell myself that now as the listing is gone and no-one can prove me wrong. I did message the seller just in case. However, I should take it as a sign that I do not need to buy a Leica digital camera. Probably in 10+ years time should I then get one. 

...or that a [[M10|Leica M10]] is just fine...
