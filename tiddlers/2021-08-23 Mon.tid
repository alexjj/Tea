huh...Literally whilst I was using this today's journal note has disappeared...I dug it out of github, although single page in git is painful. Count 3 of github saver woes.

Browsing [[Product Hunt collections|https://www.producthunt.com/collections]] is a great way to generate more ways to waste time.

Part way through my decompessing Meditations into individual tiddlers - via python not hand. I have a json of with tiddlers per book but I want per paragraph. That way I can transclude one per journal and take time to consider it, maybe reflect on it and favourite any good ones. I'm sure all that can be automated in TW but I might just do the manual transclusion. [[Stoicism]] resonates with my natural disposition so I enjoy reading about it. I also like ancient Rome and Greece so it's a good combo.

Should have a look through the [[TW dynalist|https://dynalist.io/d/zUP-nIWu2FFoXH-oM7L7d9DM]] to see if there are any good navigation ideas. I want to keep it simple. Added [[favourites|http://favorites.tiddlyspot.com/]] for now. I [[like this|https://giffmex.org/gifts/Toggle/toggle.html]] but not sure if I want to use it. Also the [[Ghostwriter theme|https://ibnishak.github.io/ghostwriter/]] looks interesting as a blog theme... Best make a [[Tiddlywiki Hacks]] page else I'll lose this.

Digging through my oldest wiki/notes backups and keeping the best parts.

I like [[Micheal's site design|https://memo.barrucadu.co.uk/]] and weekly notelogs.

[[Get ready for HAUNT 2!|https://aavegotchi.medium.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-aavegotchi-haunt-2-8bd086f9026c]] Best I can hope for is to make 10% on my GHST then win a portal with raffle tickets. Just not sure how many to use if Realms are coming along. These portals are going to be 800 GHST minimum  - that's ''$1700'', which is retarded. Although in the scale of NFTs it's a penny in the street. There are so many items going to be listed...25,944..transactions are going to timeout and all sorts of nonsense. Best tactic is to go all in on a godlike the instant it opens...but so will 1000s of others...
