Went to a conference with work today. Was both fun and unnerving at the same time. Sat there thinking that most likely someone in here has COVID ðŸ˜…

Built my new computer last night. With only nvme storage, there feels like there are so few cables in a build these days! It's lovely and shiny and new, although I had to taint it with my old, dusty graphics card until I can find a new one. Installing the CPU cooler is still terrifying.

Windows installation is very easy these days. Gone of the days needing to get drivers ready on USB drives so that the NIC works, or can display greater than 1280x720 from the graphics card. Windows still tries very hard to get you to log in with a microsoft account vs just a plain computer account. I guess if you were all in on Microsoft it would make it nice. Just like my work laptop I guess, and somewhat similar to Apple.

If I want Windows 11 I have to turn on Secure Boot in the BIOS, not sure if I want to. Only because I feel like I shouldn't have to. Really I want to run Linux on it, but it's my computer that the whole family uses and things are just generally easier on Windows. Kids want Roblox, wife wants Excel, everyone wants printers to work ðŸ˜‚

Not sure I'm noticing anything different from the new computer to the old one! More that a fresh install of windows has cleaned up years of crap. So far all I've installed is three browsers, mumble, steam, games from steam, nvidia control panel, roblox, and Disney+ app. Not even setup VS Code or git or anything. Maybe as I'm not in the mood for any of that and would rather use web apps for things.

I'm hopeful I'll snag a Founders Edition nvidia graphics card for 50% of what current models are selling for in stores. Ideally the notification from the Telegram group comes in whilst I'm at work, on the computer and not busy, and am on my phone there and then! Hopefully the store has Apple Pay express checkout, so I can just hit add, pay and get it! It pinged the other day but it was for German stores. The 3070 Ti was already sold out after 2 minutes!
