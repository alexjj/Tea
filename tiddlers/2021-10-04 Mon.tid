Thanks to [[Jack|Jack Baty]] and his [[summary guide|https://baty.blog/2021/managing-my-tiddlywiki-with-webdav/]] for [[image uploading|https://saqimtiaz.github.io/tw5-file-uploads/]] and [[TW update|https://tiddlywiki.com/#Release%205.2.0]]. I'd seen both but hadn't put the benefits of both together. 

I used the Github uploader with the file uploader plugin and it stores the images (or any files) in the `img` folder of this TW site's repo. I just tested it now on the iPad and it works great. I don't get to pick what size to upload from iOS though, at least not with drag and drop, but that's okay. It doing everything else is great. Just drag and drop! I have to have auto-save turned off to stop it getting confused - at least the plugin recommends that. Which is okay. I added the save button to the control bar so it's obvious to me I need to save.

Whilst my mum was visiting I printed off some photos for her. One of the ones she loved the most of our youngest was one I'd describe as "technically terrible". It wasn't even in focus! I'm surprised I hadn't deleted it when importing them from the camera. Probably one of the other kids took it. She loved it on screen, and loved it printed out. I'm sure it'll be in a frame on the mantelpiece etc. when we next visit. Reminds me that all these lenses and cameras and endless perfectionism over scans and Lightroom is perhaps a fools errand. However, I do them all for myself, because I like knowing that I could print this film scan to cover the whole house, even though I never will...

Speaking of which...there's a nice lens for sale on eBay USA, and even with import charges via eBay international shipment thing, it's still cheaper than locally available ones. I just worry it'll have some issue and then be a pain to return. Setup a search alert for it here and a couple have popped up already, all just auctions so have to be patient and see how they go. Potentially a chance to get a good deal on it...

[[Phil|Phil Nunnally]] has some fun with [[buying a "new" camera|https://youneedastereo.com/#2021-10-04%20Journal]] üòÅ Good choice though. If you need some starters for film simulations have a look at [[Fuji Weekly|https://fujixweekly.com/fujifilm-x-trans-ii-recipes/]]. I generally use something based on classic chrome for colour. X-Trans-2 does miss out on Acros but some of the monochrome settings look like good starters.
