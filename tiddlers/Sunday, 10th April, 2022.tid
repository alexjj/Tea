There is nothing wrong with my Jekyll blog (aside from not updating it) but I keep thinking about switching it to Hugo. Hugo seems more capable and technically better, but at the same time I don’t really know how it works and ultimately isn’t the purpose of the blog to write in not build?

I could “very quickly” rearrange my Jekyll blog to be what I need but a Hugo one would probably take a good day of fiddling. 

All this is moot as I’ll never write anything in it anyway 🤷🏼‍♂️

I’m keen to learn JavaScript now but it’ll have to wait til I get home as doing it on the iPad is not enjoyable.
