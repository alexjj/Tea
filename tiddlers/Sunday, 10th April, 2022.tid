There is nothing wrong with my Jekyll blog (aside from not updating it) but I keep thinking about switching it to Hugo. Hugo seems more capable and technically better, but at the same time I don’t really know how it works and ultimately isn’t the purpose of the blog to write in not build?

I could “very quickly” rearrange my Jekyll blog to be what I need but a Hugo one would probably take a good day of fiddling. 

All this is moot as I’ll never write anything in it anyway 🤷🏼‍♂️

I’m keen to learn JavaScript now but it’ll have to wait til I get home as doing it on the iPad is not enjoyable. It’s possible to write code on the iPad, but when you need to refer to documentation or guides for most of it then it’s a pain.

I should make a list of the things I want to do when I get back. Although it does feel a bit like the Christmas holidays where I make New Year’s resolutions, then return to the daily routine and it all falls apart. I guess making the list doesn’t hurt. I still find Dynalist the best place to put lists like these. I can have them in the wiki or elsewhere (even Apple Notes or Reminders which are on my devices) but never seem to look at them but dynalist I keep a small selection of core lists which I frequently look at.
