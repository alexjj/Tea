Photoprism continues to scanâ€¦up to 40,000 photos now. I didnâ€™t think the [[server|Home Server]] is //that// slow.

I think Kodak Gold is my favourite colour negative film stock. ISO 200 is good for Scottish summers (probably too slow for winters) and it has a warm, soothing look, like remembering a happy moment. I thought all the films I had developed were Gold but now I just remembered one was Portra 160. So I need to go and look at them in more detail and compare to Gold to see if itâ€™s worth the premium. 

I want to keep tags to a minimum on this site, but not sure when to add and when not to. I also donâ€™t think I can add tiddlers that have no tags ðŸ¤”
