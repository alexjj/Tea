     <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm mostly happy with Photos app and my photos workflow. I just feel like Auto in Lightroom does a better job than auto in Photos. Mostly I accept what comes out of camera, perhaps a little cropping, but sometimes the shadows and highlights aren't great and I want it to fix it. Perhaps my imagination but I feel like Lightroom always did a better job of it. I have to fiddle about within Photos to make it better and "ain't nobody got time for that". Adding lightroom to the mix would be a pain though. </p><p>The old <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Mac%20Mini">Mac Mini</a> seems to get worked up about importing photos and doing too many things at once. Reminds me of my thoughts about a M1/M2 mac mini.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been doing the Microsoft Rewards daily quests and searches etc. to earn reward points. I’d done 23 days straight and then forgot. Now I can’t be bothered with it. If you maintain long streaks you get bigger bonuses. The idea was to get enough points to buy something. Although it’ll take a long time. </p><p>People say they get 20k points a month, but I think a good portion is via Xbox, which I don’t have. </p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://youneedastereo.com/#One%20Camera%2C%20One%20Lens%2C%20One%20Year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phil</a> alerted me to/reminded me about The Online Photographer's blog and the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#One%20camera%2C%20one%20lens%2C%20one%20year">One camera, one lens, one year</a> project.</p><p>I love this. Well I love the idea of it. I can see myself starting then 1-2 weeks in giving up as I struggle to take enough photos. I don't really go anywhere...home, work, home, then weekend. Weekend is fine, but during the week? I do have a lot of subjects at home with kids, so maybe it's okay. If I had a pocketable camera (iPhone anyone?) then I could take it on my cycle commute and likely pick out something on the way to and from work. Maybe I'm just looking for reasons to buy another camera and seeing it in this project.</p><p>Would be great to do the film version. I'd love to do that more, but 50+ films to buy and develop is unfortunately not an insignificant amount. In fact it could probably buy a GR3 (The camera I think I'd want to use for the digital one because of it's pocketability - although the 28mm eq. is a bit wide, guess 40mm is what would be better? although doesn't <em>really</em> matter.).</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>My Raspberry Pi Zero 2 arrived today. Waiting for my soldering iron from china to arrive now before I can solder the GPIO header on and then attached it to the e-ink screen. AND then do nothing 😅</p><p>Kodak Gold 200 is now available (or about to be) in 120 format. Shame it's not the cheap, secret colour film I felt like it was just 2 years ago. I do like Gold, and it is still cheaper than Portra but it's now a price that I second guess when I look at it. Or I just hold out hope for random sales or stacking coupons etc. to get some.</p><p>Nintendo finally came through and re-sent my code via email.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>This weekend seemed to pass quickly. Sunday night and I’m reminded of those slides from work. However, I’m not going to do them because that would be sad. Plus I’m into the final 20% of Black Mesa (Half-life 1) which I want to keep playing.</p><p>Actually took some film photos this weekend. Just one roll of FP4. Probably quite a few of the images are all the same. Did make me wonder what using a digital rangefinder would be like. Part of the slowness of film is only have a few frames, and the manual focusing. With “unlimited” frames is the digital rangefinder still slow? Seems like it would be a different experience than a film M. </p><p>Someone at work, who I consider to be very intelligent, buys lottery tickets on a regular basis. The odds do increase infinitely from having no ticket to having one ticket but then to actually win, it’s so remote, so very remote. Although I can see that it’s a small amount - a coffee, or a cake etc. - purchased each week that why wouldn’t you? Saving or investing that amount instead would yield basically nothing. Still might win a £1000 or something. Maybe I should 😅 If I won £5K no prizes for guessing what I’d be ordering.</p><p>Actually considering getting the Fuji 50mm f/2 again. It seems unlikely I’ll buy anything else, and that would be useful either way. The f/1.2 would be nice but big. </p><p>Turns out I have £2.30 in my lottery account, and tomorrow is the set for life draw. £10k per month for 30 years is the headline prize. Also lottery winnings are tax free in the UK 🤑</p><p>We’ve all been playing a board game that my daughter got for her birthday - <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/310448/zombie-teenz-evolution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zombie Teens Evolution</a>. It’s pretty good, and everyone loves playing it. It’s a co-operative game to collect all the crates without the zombies taking over. The neat part is that there are a series of envelopes with extra cards, characters, abilities, etc. that you get to add to the game as you play it more. </p><p>I'm suddenly back into looking at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Sweep%20Keyboard">keyboards</a> again...</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I have a new computer but it takes the place of the previous one, I have a Nintendo Switch but it and the computer both get used by the kids and so I'm relegated to the 2012 Mac Mini. hmm...I'm running out of screens for more devices though.</p><p>I know what Jack means about having <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://baty.net/2022/feelings-about-the-leica-m10-r/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expensive things</a>. I don't have a camera of equal worth, but any time I've had expensive things - new laptops, new cameras, cars even - they've all caused a certain about of angst. You worry about damaging them or losing them or they get stolen etc. Plus there's the value or worth of it. Always there's something which is cheaper - either used or a different model - which still does the same job. Sometimes there is a quality aspect, or ability/specification or even unique functionality which can't be replicated in cheaper versions, but then the question becomes "Do I <em>really</em> need that?". </p><p>I say all this as I want a M10-P 😅    Also life's short etc...so we'll see.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I’d forgotten to setup my ipad as a HomeKit base thing after wiping it and reinstalling the OS. I was getting annoyed why stuff wasn’t working and then I realised. Stuff being the one and only smart device I have.</p><p>Boss wanted some slides today for the big boss. I did a terrible job of it and felt dumb when they pointed out the obvious. Makes me want to fix them now but they’ll keep til next week. </p><p>Bored of waiting for the founders edition GPUs to come in stock. Should buy some camera thing instead 😅</p><p>I should do something engaging so I don’t feel like I’m getting more useless and dumber. Possibly it’s too late, or maybe I’m just tired tonight.</p><p>I am too tired, because I stayed up too late watching YouTube videos about cameras.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Went to a conference with work today. Was both fun and unnerving at the same time. Sat there thinking that most likely someone in here has COVID 😅</p><p>Built my new computer last night. With only nvme storage, there feels like there are so few cables in a build these days! It's lovely and shiny and new, although I had to taint it with my old, dusty graphics card until I can find a new one. Installing the CPU cooler is still terrifying.</p><p>Windows installation is very easy these days. Gone of the days needing to get drivers ready on USB drives so that the NIC works, or can display greater than 1280x720 from the graphics card. Windows still tries very hard to get you to log in with a microsoft account vs just a plain computer account. I guess if you were all in on Microsoft it would make it nice. Just like my work laptop I guess, and somewhat similar to Apple.</p><p>If I want Windows 11 I have to turn on Secure Boot in the BIOS, not sure if I want to. Only because I feel like I shouldn't have to. Really I want to run Linux on it, but it's my computer that the whole family uses and things are just generally easier on Windows. Kids want Roblox, wife wants Excel, everyone wants printers to work 😂</p><p>Not sure I'm noticing anything different from the new computer to the old one! More that a fresh install of windows has cleaned up years of crap. So far all I've installed is three browsers, mumble, steam, games from steam, nvidia control panel, roblox, and Disney+ app. Not even setup VS Code or git or anything. Maybe as I'm not in the mood for any of that and would rather use web apps for things. I could do WSL too but think I'd rather setup VS Code server, or use the mac, or something else. It works fine but just ends up being another thing to remember how it's setup.</p><p>I'm hopeful I'll snag a Founders Edition nvidia graphics card for 50% of what current models are selling for in stores. Ideally the notification from the Telegram group comes in whilst I'm at work, on the computer and not busy, and am on my phone there and then! Hopefully the store has Apple Pay express checkout, so I can just hit add, pay and get it! It pinged the other day but it was for German stores. The 3070 Ti was already sold out after 2 minutes!</p><p>Raspberry pi zero 2 did come into stock today, so I ordered one. Been waiting since christmas to get one to go with my e-ink display I got for christmas. The zero 2 doesn't have the GPIO pins, so I ordered them but that means I need to solder them and my only soldering iron was a US one and therefore won't work here...so I should buy one of those too. Seems excessive just to add the pins but I guess a soldering iron is a useful tool to have around. Need to find a microSD card, I think I have a spare one somewhere...</p>]]>     </description></item>
