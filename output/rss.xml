     <description><![CDATA[<p>I want a <strike>Notion</strike> actually it’s probably more like an airtable equivalent for work. Ideally something that integrates with Office 365 so that it works with everything else. Microsoft was/is supposedly making something. I forget it’s name but no clear idea of when it’ll be out. I really don’t want to make an Excel spreadsheet for this stuff that’ll be a hassle to maintain. I considered Hugo in some fashion, with lots of meta data and doing stuff but seemed excessive, plus no one else would be able to update it. Equally I thought of tiddlywiki too, but same issue. Probably there’s something to be done with SharePoint lists and Power Apps, I recall thinking the same thing I while back but never looked into it. </p><p>I always have lots of things I’d like to do but never get round to them. Is it because I think of too many things or because I’m actually terrible at starting or prioritising time for them or just faff about too much looking at pointless things and wasting time. </p><p>I’m interested in doing a few web3 tutorials, to understand it better. A side effect will be creating more pointless things (nft.jpeg) but understanding more is surely a good thing. </p><p>Watching a few more thinkpads on eBay. The T490 has a model that comes with an nvidia MX250 GPU. Can’t decide if that’s a bad idea… </p><ol><li>Uses more power = shorter battery life <ol><li>I think there’s an option to switch it off and use the intel gpu. Have to consult the wiki. </li></ol></li><li>nvidia Linux drivers are terrible</li><li>I’m not playing games on this thing</li><li>Even if I wanted to, it’s not a great choice </li></ol><p>However it might be good for rendering things…? (Like what?)</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Bought that domain. Let’s see if I actually follow through on my idea…</p><p>Keep imagining the perfect home site with content and various sections, things like weekly lookbacks and links of interest, reviews of stuff…all sorts of things that I’ll never write about.</p><p>I looked at my static site this morning, I do like it, writing here is quick and easy but the static site looks nicer to read. I could export content from here to it, I might try it and see how that goes. That way I can just write here but it gets migrated across. Images might be tricky, and links, and ….everything except text so maybe that’ll be a bit of a chore. Which reminded me why I thought I’d go back to a weekly summary post on the main site. Things like interesting links I found, a summary of what I’ve been doing? Although…who cares…😅 It would just give it regular content so it doesn’t look dead.</p><p>Given up on getting a new GPU. Don’t really need it and rather spend the money elsewhere. Perhaps this time next year they’ll be more reasonable and I’ll think about it again.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing wrong with my Jekyll blog (aside from not updating it) but I keep thinking about switching it to Hugo. Hugo seems more capable and technically better, but at the same time I don’t really know how it works and ultimately isn’t the purpose of the blog to write in not build?</p><p>I could “very quickly” rearrange my Jekyll blog to be what I need but a Hugo one would probably take a good day of fiddling. </p><p>All this is moot as I’ll never write anything in it anyway 🤷🏼‍♂️</p><p>I’m keen to learn JavaScript now but it’ll have to wait til I get home as doing it on the iPad is not enjoyable. It’s possible to write code on the iPad, but when you need to refer to documentation or guides for most of it then it’s a pain.</p><p>I should make a list of the things I want to do when I get back. Although it does feel a bit like the Christmas holidays where I make New Year’s resolutions, then return to the daily routine and it all falls apart. I guess making the list doesn’t hurt. I still find Dynalist the best place to put lists like these. I can have them in the wiki or elsewhere (even Apple Notes or Reminders which are on my devices) but never seem to look at them but dynalist I keep a small selection of core lists which I frequently look at.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I feel like I should be using this time better, but I’m enjoying just sitting and reading my fiction book. Partially as I only normally read at night and if I’m tired I make it through about 2 paragraphs before falling asleep, and so now I can read several chapters all at once! I’m also in the last 10% of the last in the Stormlight series, so everything is coming to a climax.</p><p>The company I work for just bought another company. Seems good as it means there’s something more beyond the next 5 years. I did think “oh that means I can just stay here until I retire” so I’ll never do anything else. Which is maybe the easy route - although nothing is actually that easy, there’ll be re-orgs and layoffs so one can’t take anything for granted.</p><p>I’ve had an idea for a new website/app. I’ve not bought the domain yet because I worry it’ll turn into another nice idea that I do nothing about. (But what if someone else takes the domain in the mean time) - 😈 It would be a good little project to <em>actually</em> learn some JS rather than just sort of reading a book about it.</p><p>Looking <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#New%20ThinkPad">New ThinkPad</a>s.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Replit.com is a good site to use on an iPad for learning/doing software stuff. I used it a long time ago and went back to it, and it’s much better and comprehensive. You can even host websites using it and all sorts.</p><p>So I don’t <em>need</em> another laptop, although be nice to have another screen for books/resources to refer to. I should’ve bought a physical book to bring with me and that would’ve worked. Right now I’m using my phone but it’s not great. The alternative is split screen on the iPad but then they’re both very small. </p><p>Learning JavaScript seems to be mostly about remembering syntax with {} and ; and then remembering gotchas rather than anything useful. Maybe I’m still early on…</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>My last day at work before some time off for the Easter holidays. I should use that time to sort out my home page, alexjj.com. So either have a blog there, or make the blog at blog.alexjj.com (which is a wordpress site at the moment) and then just have a landing page. I like the idea of a landing page as it allows me to swap out various parts without impacting everything. I dislike having a landing page as it seems like a waste of time. </p><p>I've thought about generating a json of the old daily journals on alexjj.com jekyll site - shouldn't be too hard and use jekyll to do it - but I'm lazy. Would be nice to add those entries to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Journal">Journal</a>. I'm pretty happy with this site and my leaving and returning to it reinforces that I want it to be my permanent home for these journal posts, and general wiki stuff. I still want to generate a static site and host that on github as a backup, which should be easy but I've just not got round to it either. </p><p>The only thing with the holiday is that we're probably going away and that means I only have my iPad. This is a good thing for many reasons but also not a good thing for doing system admin. So it might lead me down the route of making a Medium account or something ridiculous 😅</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://macos8.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Go back in time to MacOS 8 online!</a></p><p>In my usual style I've downloaded a load of programming books and I'm going to "learn it all" ❤ whilst on holiday. Taking bets on "never opened them" by time I'm back at work. I think I'm forgetting to figure out the <em>why</em> of this. </p><p>Installing git on windows only makes me just want to use macos or Linux to do anything develop-y.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Dark%20Forest">Dark Forest</a> has really excited me, finding something which is blockchain related but not a stupid jpeg, not a scam or ponzi scheme, and not priced out of all but the richest people and in the spirit of open source. It's also clever, clearly made by clever people and I admire that. Plus it's a space RTS/MMO, in real time, with optimisation and customisation all over (heck you can even build and adjust your own game client!). Clearly, that means it's time for <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://mirror.xyz/alexjj.eth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another blog</a>. </p>]]>     </description></item>

I've just started my own universe with a friend whilst the main game is in limbo until the next round starts (assuming I get an entry). Mostly just want to see how it works and understand what all the fuss is about. </p><p>I do like it. There's not too many rules, but there's a lot of strategy involved. I like the time-basd nature of it, and I can see why people enjoy it. I like that there's no play to win, pay to win, or any monetary association with it. It's like software on Linux - people made it because they could, not necessarily because there was a need. But it's nice that it's open soruce, and you can add plugins via jacvascript (which other people share). There's a nice community to it, having fun, competing but working together.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://medium.com/dfdao/the-junk-wars-saga-part-iv-the-death-star-and-an-epic-conclusion-cf6cf8711116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Doesn't it just sound fun</a> 🌲🌳</p><pre><code> .   *     .       *    .🌙      *    .  *    *     *   ☄️.    *      *    .      🌍*      .     .    *   💫 *    .      *      .     .  *.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>It's <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60938730" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national take a meter reading day</a>. Not because of some patron saint or trying to encourage good habits but because most of everyone is about to suffer horrendous energy price increases. Supermarkets have reported fewer root vegetables are being sold as people don't want to use the gas to boil them. At least it's April tomorrow and maybe it'll just be an April Fools'...but if nothing else the weather should be getting slowly milder. It just delays people deciding between food and heat. I'm grateful that whilst the extra cost is horrible, it doesn't make us have to make difficult decisions. </p><p>The thing with prices going up "for temporary reasons" is that they never really seem to ever go back to where they were.</p><p>It's annoying enough that Amazon Prime Videos isn't releasing Picard Season 2 in a single lump, but that the whole world has to wait for 6 pm PDT is frustrating. Maybe I should watch Voyager until all the rest of Picard is out.</p><p>I never did anything with my home site...or that wordpress blog I made.  </p><pre><code>🌤☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️
