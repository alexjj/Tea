     <description><![CDATA[<p>Replit.com is a good site to use on an iPad for learning/doing software stuff. I used it a long time ago and went back to it, and it’s much better and comprehensive. You can even host websites using it and all sorts.</p><p>So I don’t <em>need</em> another laptop, although be nice to have another screen for books/resources to refer to. I should’ve bought a physical book to bring with me and that would’ve worked. Right now I’m using my phone but it’s not great. The alternative is split screen on the iPad but then they’re both very small. </p><p>Learning JavaScript seems to be mostly about remembering syntax with {} and ; and then remembering gotchas rather than anything useful. Maybe I’m still early on…</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>My last day at work before some time off for the Easter holidays. I should use that time to sort out my home page, alexjj.com. So either have a blog there, or make the blog at blog.alexjj.com (which is a wordpress site at the moment) and then just have a landing page. I like the idea of a landing page as it allows me to swap out various parts without impacting everything. I dislike having a landing page as it seems like a waste of time. </p><p>I've thought about generating a json of the old daily journals on alexjj.com jekyll site - shouldn't be too hard and use jekyll to do it - but I'm lazy. Would be nice to add those entries to <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Journal">Journal</a>. I'm pretty happy with this site and my leaving and returning to it reinforces that I want it to be my permanent home for these journal posts, and general wiki stuff. I still want to generate a static site and host that on github as a backup, which should be easy but I've just not got round to it either. </p><p>The only thing with the holiday is that we're probably going away and that means I only have my iPad. This is a good thing for many reasons but also not a good thing for doing system admin. So it might lead me down the route of making a Medium account or something ridiculous 😅</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://macos8.app/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Go back in time to MacOS 8 online!</a></p><p>In my usual style I've downloaded a load of programming books and I'm going to "learn it all" ❤ whilst on holiday. Taking bets on "never opened them" by time I'm back at work. I think I'm forgetting to figure out the <em>why</em> of this. </p><p>Installing git on windows only makes me just want to use macos or Linux to do anything develop-y.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Dark%20Forest">Dark Forest</a> has really excited me, finding something which is blockchain related but not a stupid jpeg, not a scam or ponzi scheme, and not priced out of all but the richest people and in the spirit of open source. It's also clever, clearly made by clever people and I admire that. Plus it's a space RTS/MMO, in real time, with optimisation and customisation all over (heck you can even build and adjust your own game client!). Clearly, that means it's time for <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://mirror.xyz/alexjj.eth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another blog</a>. </p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Been playing <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Dark%20Forest">Dark Forest</a>. The logo looks like Dwarf Fortress. I've just started my own universe with a friend whilst the main game is in limbo until the next round starts (assuming I get an entry). Mostly just want to see how it works and understand what all the fuss is about. </p><p>I do like it. There's not too many rules, but there's a lot of strategy involved. I like the time-basd nature of it, and I can see why people enjoy it. I like that there's no play to win, pay to win, or any monetary association with it. It's like software on Linux - people made it because they could, not necessarily because there was a need. But it's nice that it's open soruce, and you can add plugins via jacvascript (which other people share). There's a nice community to it, having fun, competing but working together.</p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://medium.com/dfdao/the-junk-wars-saga-part-iv-the-death-star-and-an-epic-conclusion-cf6cf8711116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Doesn't it just sound fun</a> 🌲🌳</p><pre><code> .   *     .       *    .🌙      *    .  *    *     *   ☄️.    *      *    .      🌍*      .     .    *   💫 *    .      *      .     .  *.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>It's <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60938730" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national take a meter reading day</a>. Not because of some patron saint or trying to encourage good habits but because most of everyone is about to suffer horrendous energy price increases. Supermarkets have reported fewer root vegetables are being sold as people don't want to use the gas to boil them. At least it's April tomorrow and maybe it'll just be an April Fools'...but if nothing else the weather should be getting slowly milder. It just delays people deciding between food and heat. I'm grateful that whilst the extra cost is horrible, it doesn't make us have to make difficult decisions. </p><p>The thing with prices going up "for temporary reasons" is that they never really seem to ever go back to where they were.</p><p>It's annoying enough that Amazon Prime Videos isn't releasing Picard Season 2 in a single lump, but that the whole world has to wait for 6 pm PDT is frustrating. Maybe I should watch Voyager until all the rest of Picard is out.</p><p>I never did anything with my home site...or that wordpress blog I made.  </p><pre><code>🌤☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️

     <description><![CDATA[<p>My 50 mm f/2 fuji lens arrived today. I took a picture of it and my other fuji primes. However, my phone didn't save the photos...so I don't have it, and now I can't be bothered to line them all up again. Also annoyingly I'd taken a meter reading with it and now I don't know what it was, and again, can't be bothered to go back outside and check it. Clearly if I had <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Leica%20M10">another camera</a>, this wouldn't have been an issue.</p><p>My iPad had some issue a while back and I had to factory restore it, now I think my iPhone has a similar issue and needs wiping. It is a good way to clear out junk apps that I don't really need.</p><p>After a lovely warm weekend, today's weather has been extremely variable. Snow, sun, hail, rain, and now sun again. But cold.</p><p>Started watching Picard season two. How does Picard get to the Stargazer so quickly in the first episode? I guess that space anomaly must be close to Earth? I normally don't care about things like this as it's a story, but normally Star Trek is good about this stuff. I don't care enough to google it or start a thread about it though, and am just continuing to watch it.</p><p>It's been about 3 weeks since I joined the nvidia FE GPU telegram channel, several EU ones have come up and 3090 Ti but I don't really want to spend £1900 on a GPU...it is the very fastest one but never buy the very fastest one. I know the ones I want will appear when I'm driving, or presenting a meeting, or generally doing something where I can't immediately buy it. </p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm mostly happy with Photos app and my photos workflow. I just feel like Auto in Lightroom does a better job than auto in Photos. Mostly I accept what comes out of camera, perhaps a little cropping, but sometimes the shadows and highlights aren't great and I want it to fix it. Perhaps my imagination but I feel like Lightroom always did a better job of it. I have to fiddle about within Photos to make it better and "ain't nobody got time for that". Adding lightroom to the mix would be a pain though. </p><p>The old <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Mac%20Mini">Mac Mini</a> seems to get worked up about importing photos and doing too many things at once. Reminds me of my thoughts about a M1/M2 mac mini.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been doing the Microsoft Rewards daily quests and searches etc. to earn reward points. I’d done 23 days straight and then forgot. Now I can’t be bothered with it. If you maintain long streaks you get bigger bonuses. The idea was to get enough points to buy something. Although it’ll take a long time. </p><p>People say they get 20k points a month, but I think a good portion is via Xbox, which I don’t have. </p>]]>     </description></item>
