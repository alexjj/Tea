     <description><![CDATA[<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://youneedastereo.com/#One%20Camera%2C%20One%20Lens%2C%20One%20Year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phil</a> alerted me to/reminded me about The Online Photographer's blog and the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#One%20camera%2C%20one%20lens%2C%20one%20year">One camera, one lens, one year</a> project.</p><p>I love this. Well I love the idea of it. I can see myself starting then 1-2 weeks in giving up as I struggle to take enough photos. I don't really go anywhere...home, work, home, then weekend. Weekend is fine, but during the week? I do have a lot of subjects at home with kids, so maybe it's okay. If I had a pocketable camera (iPhone anyone?) then I could take it on my cycle commute and likely pick out something on the way to and from work. Maybe I'm just looking for reasons to buy another camera and seeing it in this project.</p><p>Would be great to do the film version. I'd love to do that more, but 50+ films to buy and develop is unfortunately not an insignificant amount. In fact it could probably buy a GR3 (The camera I think I'd want to use for the digital one because of it's pocketability - although the 28mm eq. is a bit wide, guess 40mm is what would be better? although doesn't <em>really</em> matter.).</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>My Raspberry Pi Zero 2 arrived today. Waiting for my soldering iron from china to arrive now before I can solder the GPIO header on and then attached it to the e-ink screen. AND then do nothing 😅</p><p>Kodak Gold 200 is now available (or about to be) in 120 format. Shame it's not the cheap, secret colour film I felt like it was just 2 years ago. I do like Gold, and it is still cheaper than Portra but it's now a price that I second guess when I look at it. Or I just hold out hope for random sales or stacking coupons etc. to get some.</p><p>Nintendo finally came through and re-sent my code via email.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>This weekend seemed to pass quickly. Sunday night and I’m reminded of those slides from work. However, I’m not going to do them because that would be sad. Plus I’m into the final 20% of Black Mesa (Half-life 1) which I want to keep playing.</p><p>Actually took some film photos this weekend. Just one roll of FP4. Probably quite a few of the images are all the same. Did make me wonder what using a digital rangefinder would be like. Part of the slowness of film is only have a few frames, and the manual focusing. With “unlimited” frames is the digital rangefinder still slow? Seems like it would be a different experience than a film M. </p><p>Someone at work, who I consider to be very intelligent, buys lottery tickets on a regular basis. The odds do increase infinitely from having no ticket to having one ticket but then to actually win, it’s so remote, so very remote. Although I can see that it’s a small amount - a coffee, or a cake etc. - purchased each week that why wouldn’t you? Saving or investing that amount instead would yield basically nothing. Still might win a £1000 or something. Maybe I should 😅 If I won £5K no prizes for guessing what I’d be ordering.</p><p>Actually considering getting the Fuji 50mm f/2 again. It seems unlikely I’ll buy anything else, and that would be useful either way. The f/1.2 would be nice but big. </p><p>Turns out I have £2.30 in my lottery account, and tomorrow is the set for life draw. £10k per month for 30 years is the headline prize. Also lottery winnings are tax free in the UK 🤑</p><p>We’ve all been playing a board game that my daughter got for her birthday - <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/310448/zombie-teenz-evolution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zombie Teens Evolution</a>. It’s pretty good, and everyone loves playing it. It’s a co-operative game to collect all the crates without the zombies taking over. The neat part is that there are a series of envelopes with extra cards, characters, abilities, etc. that you get to add to the game as you play it more. </p><p>I'm suddenly back into looking at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Sweep%20Keyboard">keyboards</a> again...</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I have a new computer but it takes the place of the previous one, I have a Nintendo Switch but it and the computer both get used by the kids and so I'm relegated to the 2012 Mac Mini. hmm...I'm running out of screens for more devices though.</p><p>I know what Jack means about having <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://baty.net/2022/feelings-about-the-leica-m10-r/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expensive things</a>. I don't have a camera of equal worth, but any time I've had expensive things - new laptops, new cameras, cars even - they've all caused a certain about of angst. You worry about damaging them or losing them or they get stolen etc. Plus there's the value or worth of it. Always there's something which is cheaper - either used or a different model - which still does the same job. Sometimes there is a quality aspect, or ability/specification or even unique functionality which can't be replicated in cheaper versions, but then the question becomes "Do I <em>really</em> need that?". </p><p>I say all this as I want a M10-P 😅    Also life's short etc...so we'll see.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I’d forgotten to setup my ipad as a HomeKit base thing after wiping it and reinstalling the OS. I was getting annoyed why stuff wasn’t working and then I realised. Stuff being the one and only smart device I have.</p><p>Boss wanted some slides today for the big boss. I did a terrible job of it and felt dumb when they pointed out the obvious. Makes me want to fix them now but they’ll keep til next week. </p><p>Bored of waiting for the founders edition GPUs to come in stock. Should buy some camera thing instead 😅</p><p>I should do something engaging so I don’t feel like I’m getting more useless and dumber. Possibly it’s too late, or maybe I’m just tired tonight.</p><p>I am too tired, because I stayed up too late watching YouTube videos about cameras.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Went to a conference with work today. Was both fun and unnerving at the same time. Sat there thinking that most likely someone in here has COVID 😅</p><p>Built my new computer last night. With only nvme storage, there feels like there are so few cables in a build these days! It's lovely and shiny and new, although I had to taint it with my old, dusty graphics card until I can find a new one. Installing the CPU cooler is still terrifying.</p><p>Windows installation is very easy these days. Gone of the days needing to get drivers ready on USB drives so that the NIC works, or can display greater than 1280x720 from the graphics card. Windows still tries very hard to get you to log in with a microsoft account vs just a plain computer account. I guess if you were all in on Microsoft it would make it nice. Just like my work laptop I guess, and somewhat similar to Apple.</p><p>If I want Windows 11 I have to turn on Secure Boot in the BIOS, not sure if I want to. Only because I feel like I shouldn't have to. Really I want to run Linux on it, but it's my computer that the whole family uses and things are just generally easier on Windows. Kids want Roblox, wife wants Excel, everyone wants printers to work 😂</p><p>Not sure I'm noticing anything different from the new computer to the old one! More that a fresh install of windows has cleaned up years of crap. So far all I've installed is three browsers, mumble, steam, games from steam, nvidia control panel, roblox, and Disney+ app. Not even setup VS Code or git or anything. Maybe as I'm not in the mood for any of that and would rather use web apps for things. I could do WSL too but think I'd rather setup VS Code server, or use the mac, or something else. It works fine but just ends up being another thing to remember how it's setup.</p><p>I'm hopeful I'll snag a Founders Edition nvidia graphics card for 50% of what current models are selling for in stores. Ideally the notification from the Telegram group comes in whilst I'm at work, on the computer and not busy, and am on my phone there and then! Hopefully the store has Apple Pay express checkout, so I can just hit add, pay and get it! It pinged the other day but it was for German stores. The 3070 Ti was already sold out after 2 minutes!</p><p>Raspberry pi zero 2 did come into stock today, so I ordered one. Been waiting since christmas to get one to go with my e-ink display I got for christmas. The zero 2 doesn't have the GPIO pins, so I ordered them but that means I need to solder them and my only soldering iron was a US one and therefore won't work here...so I should buy one of those too. Seems excessive just to add the pins but I guess a soldering iron is a useful tool to have around. Need to find a microSD card, I think I have a spare one somewhere...</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Unsurprisingly Nintendo came back with "this department can't help you. Please submit another support ticket". The department suggested in the last email didn't exist as a drop-down...3 times the charm...I hope.</p><p>Several M10-Ps I was looking at are actually on sale, and much cheaper than I originally though...oh dear...</p><p>At a much smaller scale, I bought Mass Effect Legendary edition as it's 55% off in Steam sale. I used to own ME1 and 2 but never played them. I think they were the last games I bought on CD/DVD before everything was Steam downloads. The legendary edition includes all three games, all the DLCs, graphics upgrades and bug fixes and all sorts. A friend has played it recently and said it was exceptionally good. Given I've never played the series before, and it's supposed to be one of the great computer game story series, I'm looking forward to it. All in all good value for £20. </p><p>This site, and several before this, were all originally made for me to ‘improve myself’. Writing things down, reflect upon them, change for the better. Etc. I guess I’ve done, or partially done, step 1. Possibly the things I have written down aren’t material that one can use to improve. Endless prattling about buying things no-one really needs? Not that I’m expecting to write groundbreaking original thought. </p><p>Ultimately though, nothing that I do or don’t do matters in the grand scheme of the universe. I should undertake my daily obligations to family and friends in a way that I’d like them to do to me. I should be content, there is always more. </p><p>I should read something that’s a bit more thoughtful rather than my epic fantasy books. </p><p>Sometimes I feel like I’ve regressed. I’m not achieving new things, or learning new skills or creating new content. I’m playing computer games. But is that really bad? Does it really matter? Sometimes I think no, sometimes I think yes. There are always people to compare to who do more, and people who do less - both may be content or both may be unhappy. These things are too deep to think about.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>That M10P sold, and now it seems like it was a much better deal that I thought. However, it’s considerably more expensive than anything I’ve bought before so my ability to actually buy it is still very low! </p><p>Time to play some Black Mesa instead. I can’t remember anything from playing Half-Life 1 originally so it’s like a new game. The graphics are much better than the original too so that helps. Although in my head this is what the graphics were like…even though they’re much better. It was similar when watching Diablo 2 resurrected videos. They’ve enhanced the graphics but in my head that’s what they used to look like - and then they show you the original, oh yes, they were really that bad! However, that is a game I definitely don’t have time for.</p><p>I lost my code for Mario Kart 8 DLC. So mostly my fault, I guess I deleted the email..?.. and now it’s been more than 30 days so Gmail has deleted it. However, the fact that the Nintendo Store has no purchase history, nor the ability to directly apply a game code to the account you just purchased it with, AND when you purchase a game code you have to wait until one week before its release before you can apply it…? Why? Nintendo make some great games but they seem to suck at basic account stuff or online play or the whole ecosystem. So I emailed support, who closed the ticket saying I should contact the “My Nintendo store” rather than Nintendo Support. Obviously. Except they provide a link, which has a submit a message box, which goes to…Nintendo Support. Tried some different drop downs to see if it goes to the right place. I got a please provide feedback on our customer support after today’s closed ticket. Needless to say I scored them very poorly. Okay I understand Nintendo has multiple departments and different people work on different things but come on, support should redirect to the right place. Nintendo is one company. I won’t be surprised when they finally tell me that “they have no ability to resend the code and I have to buy it again”. Hopefully I’ll be proved wrong. Unfortunately I probably will buy it again if it comes to it, as everyone in the house loves Mario Kart and new tracks would be fun. I’ll be sure to buy it from some “dodgy” keys website…who allow you to access your key online and have a record of transactions in your account…</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You can call me Al
</p><cite>Paul Simon</cite></blockquote><p>What is this song about? 😵‍💫</p><p>Most of the new computer parts have arrived. Just waiting on the CPU, which should hopefully come next couple of days. I've got some old Windows keys from previous laptops. I wonder if any of them will activate Windows 10...If none of them do, then do I transfer my existing computer's key or buy another? Really don't want to buy Windows. I can't even remember the last time I did. Perhaps Windows 7? Think I got that from student discount at university. I guess I can install Linux on the old computer...although not sure what that's going to be used for. Supposedly saved for the kids but they're not going to want to play on it for several years I think, and there's nowhere for it to go at the moment. Apart from the graphics card, it's worthless though, so might as well keep it for spare. Even if it just sits in the loft for a while. </p><p>I've one solitary colour film, Fujicolor 100, from about 2 weeks ago waiting to be developed. Maybe I should just send it off on its own. </p><p>That M10-P I was debating about has gone from eBay. I think the seller cancelled the listing as eBay says it was taken down due to an error, perhaps he realised it was significantly cheaper than all the other listings? I was close to getting it....well I tell myself that now as the listing is gone and no-one can prove me wrong. I did message the seller just in case. However, I should take it as a sign that I do not need to buy a Leica digital camera. Probably in 10+ years time should I then get one. </p><p>...or that a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Leica%20M10">M10</a> is just fine...</p>]]>     </description></item>
