     <description><![CDATA[<p>It's <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60938730" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">national take a meter reading day</a>. Not because of some patron saint or trying to encourage good habits but because most of everyone is about to suffer horrendous energy price increases. Supermarkets have reported fewer root vegetables are being sold as people don't want to use the gas to boil them. At least it's April tomorrow and maybe it'll just be an April Fools'...but if nothing else the weather should be getting slowly milder. It just delays people deciding between food and heat. I'm grateful that whilst the extra cost is horrible, it doesn't make us have to make difficult decisions. </p><p>The thing with prices going up "for temporary reasons" is that they never really seem to ever go back to where they were.</p><p>It's annoying enough that Amazon Prime Videos isn't releasing Picard Season 2 in a single lump, but that the whole world has to wait for 6 pm PDT is frustrating. Maybe I should watch Voyager until all the rest of Picard is out.</p><p>I never did anything with my home site...or that wordpress blog I made.  </p><pre><code>🌤☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️☁️

     <description><![CDATA[<p>My 50 mm f/2 fuji lens arrived today. I took a picture of it and my other fuji primes. However, my phone didn't save the photos...so I don't have it, and now I can't be bothered to line them all up again. Also annoyingly I'd taken a meter reading with it and now I don't know what it was, and again, can't be bothered to go back outside and check it. Clearly if I had <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Leica%20M10">another camera</a>, this wouldn't have been an issue.</p><p>My iPad had some issue a while back and I had to factory restore it, now I think my iPhone has a similar issue and needs wiping. It is a good way to clear out junk apps that I don't really need.</p><p>After a lovely warm weekend, today's weather has been extremely variable. Snow, sun, hail, rain, and now sun again. But cold.</p><p>Started watching Picard season two. How does Picard get to the Stargazer so quickly in the first episode? I guess that space anomaly must be close to Earth? I normally don't care about things like this as it's a story, but normally Star Trek is good about this stuff. I don't care enough to google it or start a thread about it though, and am just continuing to watch it.</p><p>It's been about 3 weeks since I joined the nvidia FE GPU telegram channel, several EU ones have come up and 3090 Ti but I don't really want to spend £1900 on a GPU...it is the very fastest one but never buy the very fastest one. I know the ones I want will appear when I'm driving, or presenting a meeting, or generally doing something where I can't immediately buy it. </p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm mostly happy with Photos app and my photos workflow. I just feel like Auto in Lightroom does a better job than auto in Photos. Mostly I accept what comes out of camera, perhaps a little cropping, but sometimes the shadows and highlights aren't great and I want it to fix it. Perhaps my imagination but I feel like Lightroom always did a better job of it. I have to fiddle about within Photos to make it better and "ain't nobody got time for that". Adding lightroom to the mix would be a pain though. </p><p>The old <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Mac%20Mini">Mac Mini</a> seems to get worked up about importing photos and doing too many things at once. Reminds me of my thoughts about a M1/M2 mac mini.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been doing the Microsoft Rewards daily quests and searches etc. to earn reward points. I’d done 23 days straight and then forgot. Now I can’t be bothered with it. If you maintain long streaks you get bigger bonuses. The idea was to get enough points to buy something. Although it’ll take a long time. </p><p>People say they get 20k points a month, but I think a good portion is via Xbox, which I don’t have. </p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://youneedastereo.com/#One%20Camera%2C%20One%20Lens%2C%20One%20Year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phil</a> alerted me to/reminded me about The Online Photographer's blog and the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#One%20camera%2C%20one%20lens%2C%20one%20year">One camera, one lens, one year</a> project.</p><p>I love this. Well I love the idea of it. I can see myself starting then 1-2 weeks in giving up as I struggle to take enough photos. I don't really go anywhere...home, work, home, then weekend. Weekend is fine, but during the week? I do have a lot of subjects at home with kids, so maybe it's okay. If I had a pocketable camera (iPhone anyone?) then I could take it on my cycle commute and likely pick out something on the way to and from work. Maybe I'm just looking for reasons to buy another camera and seeing it in this project.</p><p>Would be great to do the film version. I'd love to do that more, but 50+ films to buy and develop is unfortunately not an insignificant amount. In fact it could probably buy a GR3 (The camera I think I'd want to use for the digital one because of it's pocketability - although the 28mm eq. is a bit wide, guess 40mm is what would be better? although doesn't <em>really</em> matter.).</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>My Raspberry Pi Zero 2 arrived today. Waiting for my soldering iron from china to arrive now before I can solder the GPIO header on and then attached it to the e-ink screen. AND then do nothing 😅</p><p>Kodak Gold 200 is now available (or about to be) in 120 format. Shame it's not the cheap, secret colour film I felt like it was just 2 years ago. I do like Gold, and it is still cheaper than Portra but it's now a price that I second guess when I look at it. Or I just hold out hope for random sales or stacking coupons etc. to get some.</p><p>Nintendo finally came through and re-sent my code via email.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>This weekend seemed to pass quickly. Sunday night and I’m reminded of those slides from work. However, I’m not going to do them because that would be sad. Plus I’m into the final 20% of Black Mesa (Half-life 1) which I want to keep playing.</p><p>Actually took some film photos this weekend. Just one roll of FP4. Probably quite a few of the images are all the same. Did make me wonder what using a digital rangefinder would be like. Part of the slowness of film is only have a few frames, and the manual focusing. With “unlimited” frames is the digital rangefinder still slow? Seems like it would be a different experience than a film M. </p><p>Someone at work, who I consider to be very intelligent, buys lottery tickets on a regular basis. The odds do increase infinitely from having no ticket to having one ticket but then to actually win, it’s so remote, so very remote. Although I can see that it’s a small amount - a coffee, or a cake etc. - purchased each week that why wouldn’t you? Saving or investing that amount instead would yield basically nothing. Still might win a £1000 or something. Maybe I should 😅 If I won £5K no prizes for guessing what I’d be ordering.</p><p>Actually considering getting the Fuji 50mm f/2 again. It seems unlikely I’ll buy anything else, and that would be useful either way. The f/1.2 would be nice but big. </p><p>Turns out I have £2.30 in my lottery account, and tomorrow is the set for life draw. £10k per month for 30 years is the headline prize. Also lottery winnings are tax free in the UK 🤑</p><p>We’ve all been playing a board game that my daughter got for her birthday - <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/310448/zombie-teenz-evolution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zombie Teens Evolution</a>. It’s pretty good, and everyone loves playing it. It’s a co-operative game to collect all the crates without the zombies taking over. The neat part is that there are a series of envelopes with extra cards, characters, abilities, etc. that you get to add to the game as you play it more. </p><p>I'm suddenly back into looking at <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Sweep%20Keyboard">keyboards</a> again...</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I have a new computer but it takes the place of the previous one, I have a Nintendo Switch but it and the computer both get used by the kids and so I'm relegated to the 2012 Mac Mini. hmm...I'm running out of screens for more devices though.</p><p>I know what Jack means about having <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://baty.net/2022/feelings-about-the-leica-m10-r/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expensive things</a>. I don't have a camera of equal worth, but any time I've had expensive things - new laptops, new cameras, cars even - they've all caused a certain about of angst. You worry about damaging them or losing them or they get stolen etc. Plus there's the value or worth of it. Always there's something which is cheaper - either used or a different model - which still does the same job. Sometimes there is a quality aspect, or ability/specification or even unique functionality which can't be replicated in cheaper versions, but then the question becomes "Do I <em>really</em> need that?". </p><p>I say all this as I want a M10-P 😅    Also life's short etc...so we'll see.</p>]]>     </description></item>
