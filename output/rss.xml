     <description><![CDATA[<p>That M10P sold, and now it seems like it was a much better deal that I thought. However, it’s considerably more expensive than anything I’ve bought before so my ability to actually buy it is still very low! </p><p>Time to play some Black Mesa instead. I can’t remember anything from playing Half-Life 1 originally so it’s like a new game. The graphics are much better than the original too so that helps. Although in my head this is what the graphics were like…even though they’re much better. It was similar when watching Diablo 2 resurrected videos. They’ve enhanced the graphics but in my head that’s what they used to look like - and then they show you the original, oh yes, they were really that bad! However, that is a game I definitely don’t have time for.</p><p>I lost my code for Mario Kart 8 DLC. So mostly my fault, I guess I deleted the email..?.. and now it’s been more than 30 days so Gmail has deleted it. However, the fact that the Nintendo Store has no purchase history, nor the ability to directly apply a game code to the account you just purchased it with, AND when you purchase a game code you have to wait until one week before its release before you can apply it…? Why? Nintendo make some great games but they seem to suck at basic account stuff or online play or the whole ecosystem. So I emailed support, who closed the ticket saying I should contact the “My Nintendo store” rather than Nintendo Support. Obviously. Except they provide a link, which has a submit a message box, which goes to…Nintendo Support. Tried some different drop downs to see if it goes to the right place. I got a please provide feedback on our customer support after today’s closed ticket. Needless to say I scored them very poorly. Okay I understand Nintendo has multiple departments and different people work on different things but come on, support should redirect to the right place. Nintendo is one company. I won’t be surprised when they finally tell me that “they have no ability to resend the code and I have to buy it again”. Hopefully I’ll be proved wrong. Unfortunately I probably will buy it again if it comes to it, as everyone in the house loves Mario Kart and new tracks would be fun. I’ll be sure to buy it from some “dodgy” keys website…who allow you to access your key online and have a record of transactions in your account…</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You can call me Al
</p><cite>Paul Simon</cite></blockquote><p>What is this song about? 😵‍💫</p><p>Most of the new computer parts have arrived. Just waiting on the CPU, which should hopefully come next couple of days. I've got some old Windows keys from previous laptops. I wonder if any of them will activate Windows 10...If none of them do, then do I transfer my existing computer's key or buy another? Really don't want to buy Windows. I can't even remember the last time I did. Perhaps Windows 7? Think I got that from student discount at university. I guess I can install Linux on the old computer...although not sure what that's going to be used for. Supposedly saved for the kids but they're not going to want to play on it for several years I think, and there's nowhere for it to go at the moment. Apart from the graphics card, it's worthless though, so might as well keep it for spare. Even if it just sits in the loft for a while. </p><p>I've one solitary colour film, Fujicolor 100, from about 2 weeks ago waiting to be developed. Maybe I should just send it off on its own. </p><p>That M10-P I was debating about has gone from eBay. I think the seller cancelled the listing as eBay says it was taken down due to an error, perhaps he realised it was significantly cheaper than all the other listings? I was close to getting it....well I tell myself that now as the listing is gone and no-one can prove me wrong. I did message the seller just in case. However, I should take it as a sign that I do not need to buy a Leica digital camera. Probably in 10+ years time should I then get one. </p><p>...or that a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Leica%20M10">M10</a> is just fine...</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>After seeing an offer on a 5600X, it turned into buying a whole new computer! 😅  The hardest part is deciding on getting a new graphics card (or not). My current one, RTX 1060, isn't shabby, plus pricing is insane right now. The best option is getting a founder's edition - which for some reason is sold at RRP - but there's only one store that sells them and they only get a few in stock every couple of weeks. </p><p>I did fret about the motherboard that I bought. Probably best not reading reviews, as generally people only leave reviews if things don't work, and there are likely hundreds which are perfectly fine. Similarly with buying a PSU, there are so many options, it's best not to get bogged down into the details and just pick a known brand at a reasonable price point.</p><p>It should all be arriving over the next few days, so I'll be having fun building ... it'll be my first build in just over 10 years! </p><p>I sort of want to install Linux, but given everyone else in the house uses it, I'll probably start with Windows, may even go to 11. </p><p>Installed Wordpress to blog.alexjj.com. Haven't done anything with it yet, and not sure if I want to but the ease of it appeals to me. I think it'll help me write more...? It does make me nervous about databases and things and not having the material in plain-ish text. I suppose there's backup methods and things.</p><p>Also been thinking about having a semi-crazy landing page, just because why not. I used to have this <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://alexjj.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one</a>.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I've not got excited about FreeBSD or OpenBSD in a while. Graphic card prices seem to be slowly coming back down to Earth. Perhaps in a couple of months they'll be available and MSRP (°ロ°)</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Now <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021210080822/http://textism.com:80/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this is how you write an about page</a>.</p><p>I’m enjoying writing back in the wiki. I do occasionally look at my other site and admire the aesthetics, but this theme has helped me enjoy the look of it again. Must be the rounded corners. The edit box is nicer looking than stock TW.</p><p>Felt like I did a fraction of the work today in the office compared to yesterday at home. Guess I did a lot of tiny things and answering various emails - answering emails is such a waste of time. People do need answers but it’s so slow and whilst it feels like accomplishing things, it doesn’t. I need to fully migrate into loqseq and not mostly sit in it but with still some tiddlywiki and even OneNote on the side. Copying and pasting into Loqseq from tiddlywiki wasn’t a pleasant experience. Maybe I have to import files instead, or open them in another editor first. I wondered about going back to tiddlywiki, especially as I found Stroll with its side by side tiddlers. However, the rapid entry of stuff on a day is useful at work. I’m also slowly learning the keyboard shortcuts. </p><p>I think I’m just not very good at using todo systems. I never clean them up, or do the items or process them. Occasionally they act as reminders to do things. I should try and get better at it. The best thing is usually writing a list on paper that morning. </p><p>Keep thinking about a M10. Seems much more exciting to use than the Fuji. But maybe I just lust after it as I don’t have it. The Fuji is very functional and practical. I took some nice pictures of the kids at the beach at the weekend with it. I wonder if I’d get as nice photos with the Leica as it’s manual focus? It would certainly allow for more use of interesting or characterful lenses. I could use them on the film M, but film is limited (ISO and exposures). I do love film but I can’t use it all the time. The M10 is still expensive though. Over 12x what I paid for the X-T2. Maybe I should define myself a savings period. I could just buy it right now, but perhaps if I artificially set aside money for x months and then buy it, it might not that feel as expensive…it’ll still feel expensive. Even over a year it’s £300/month, doesn’t matter how you slice it. Maybe for my next reminder 0 %5 birthday? Still a worry that it’ll not be what I expect it to be, because I’m not a better photographer because of it. However, I’ve take a lot of nice photos with the M2, even of the kids…so it can be done. Just film often forgives more or I forgive it more. Perhaps some Lightroom super noise filters will hide the imperfections.</p><p>I finally setup icloud+ custom email. It’s funny having a new email address. I get about 1 email every 2 days 😅 Versus endlessly trying to spam and unsubscribe from endless things on my gmail. I have a lot of newsletters that I signed up to, but they all seem to come on the same day and I can even get 1-2 weeks behind on reading them. I suppose I can just delete them and move on. </p><p>I want to do a <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/study/postgraduate/brewing-distilling.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">masters in brewing</a>.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>A nice day working at home. Lots of number crunching today which is always satisfying. Even continued into the evening as I was on a roll and didn’t want to have the mental effort of getting back into it tomorrow after going to sleep.</p><p>Blowing a gale today, so a good day to skip cycling to work. Also fixed my rear mudguard, although the screw got stripped when attaching it back to the frame. Next time it works loose I’ll have to find a replacement. Chain and drive train were absolutely filthy, did a half assed job at cleaning it, and then applied some oil. Could do with a chain bath and full scrub down.</p><p>If I wait long enough then I stop wanting to buy things. </p><p>I had thought about getting a new Mac mini with today’s announcement incoming. Although seems it’s the Mac Studio instead, which has great specs, looks…a little odd…but likely overkill and expensive for me. The matching 27” 5K monitor is nice but, again, expensive. I’ve not read all the stuff about them yet so maybe I might be more interested. Although really it’s down the pecking order in terms of new computers to buy. </p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Got a new desk at work, in the refurbed part of the office. The lighting is much nicer, but otherwise it’s the same. I think the desks are closer together and there’s nowhere nearby to hang my coat. There’s various tables and chairs and things in the middle of walkways. They look nice but I can never see myself using them. I also miss 16x10 monitors we used to have, and particularly the 27” monitors I used to have. We had nice new 24” Dells, but they’re small, and 16x9. </p><p>The big boss came and spoke to someone next to me, and then chatted with me. Feel like I always act so weird and not normal when he does. I had just spent all afternoon trying to solve something which was very disheartening as there were so many issues. </p><p>Finished listening to the latest Serial (together with New York Times) podcast. Was good to listen to but ended very nothingy, which I guess just reflects the situation. Picked up my python podcasts, feels like it’s been a while, and then got all excited for making some web apps. I know I’ll not actually do anything…dare I look up when I was talking about learning Javascript. Still on chapter 2 of that book…think if I open preview it’s still there.</p><p>I like doing computer projects but I also like getting away from the computer. I don’t do a very good job at getting away from it, as it’s my habit to go sit on it once the kids go to bed. I’m trying to avoid it now by sitting on my ipad on the sofa but I’m just delaying the inevitable. Learning programming stuff just means spending more time on there. My trousers are reminding me I should be doing some more exercise, and I’d love to buy a rowing machine but I don’t think I’d really use it. Cycling to work isn’t quite enough, and it’s too much hassle to use the gym near work as then it means I have to cycle in with change of clothes and stuff. </p><p>I thought about subscribing to IEEE Spectrum for the magazine, so I’d read interesting topics but away from the computer. But I haven’t yet. </p><p>My rear mud guard has come away from the frame and means I need to remove the rear wheel to secure it again. Ugh.  </p><p>Can’t decide if I like the “Also on today” part of the entries. </p><p>Thinking of getting the Fuji 50mm f/2. The f/1.2 sounds really nice but it's a big boy, and I really like how the 35mm f/2 feels and balances on the camera. </p><p>Think I should increase my pension contribution. I "make" more money by doing that, and in theory means I'll be able to stop work sooner. But I don't like not having the choice, however, if the saving is done for me and I don't get a say then I'll just work round it, and likely my future self will thank my past self. </p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I've spent all last evening and some of today rebuilding my tiddlywiki site (this one). It's remarkably identical to my last one...hmm...it is now running on node.js, vs. just a static hosted Github saver version. So a least I shouldn't get any issues from Github saver any more. I think I'll setup auto git commits to Github and then the action to build it into a static site. </p><p>I'm using a new theme: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://odinjorna.github.io/zacht-theme/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zacht</a>. I like most things but not quite everything. So not sure what I'll do about that - probably nothing for a long time. <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://nicolas.petton.fr/tw/notebook.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Notebook</a> was another theme I liked, particularly the centralised search bar and buttons at the top. I just really don't like the left hand sidebar, not because it's on the left but it just looks ugly. However, don't be surprised if you show up and we're running the notebook theme 😂</p><p>I suppose it's like tidying your desk, or slightly rearranging things. Doesn't materially change anything but makes you feel better and gives a new lease of life to get on with something. </p><p>Now I just have to decide what to do with my main site. </p><p>Went to the beach today and took the Fuji X-T2 and 35mm f/2. Do enjoy digital and autofocus! Not sure if it's the lens or the surroundings but I'm liking the classic chrome look again. Perhaps both, together with the bright light that makes it look good. I keep eyeing the X-E4 - partially for size, for Classic neg, and for the last new fuji with a pop out screen that's not articulating. I don't want it out on the side to angle it up or down. Not sure about the grip on it though, although it's a small prime camera really, and you can get a grip add on. I remember looking at the X-T2 when it came out and, compared to my Nikon, I thought the grip was terrible on it. Now I find it perfectly suitable. Not sure I really need to spend £800 on another digital camera though - espeically as it's pretty much the same. The X-T2 isn't exactly massive. </p><p>I did think about taking the M2 today, but I had all the kids so didn't think I'd have capacity for manual camera. Although with good light I could've just had it at f/8 the whole time. However, it's also nice to see the images immediately. Film is also getting really expensive. I know I just talked about buying an £800 camera but colour is pretty much £10 a roll now. Probably going to be just black and white soon enough, and maybe colour for a special occasion, or if some decent sales come along. </p><p>For a long time I've been jpeg "SOOC" with the Fujis. I save RAW but have never used it. Today I did start thinking about processing RAWs, and maybe making some of my own presets for them - to speed up the process. Could be wishful thinking as I don't have lots of free time I sometimes resent spending it faffing about on things like this. Particularly when the only person who notices or cares is me - which is a good reason but not just now.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I still don't love the look of tiddlywiki, and changing it seems complex, or at least more complex than I'm interested in figuring out. Although I did remind myself of the look I made in <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://fondoftea.com/blog/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a> example. The top part looks nice on desktop but just doesn't work on mobile. The problem with tiddlywiki is that I just want to start again, rather than trying to unpack what I previously did. I guess I can just export everything as JSON and do that. Or I tell myself I'll make another blog and then import it all but I get so far and get bored/distracted.</p><p>Then I remember about <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://giffmex.org/stroll/stroll.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stroll</a>.</p><p>I've gone to the bother of making this site but now I'm still not sure it's what I want...</p>]]>     </description></item>
