     <description><![CDATA[<p>Now <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021210080822/http://textism.com:80/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this is how you write an about page</a>.</p><p>I’m enjoying writing back in the wiki. I do occasionally look at my other site and admire the aesthetics, but this theme has helped me enjoy the look of it again. Must be the rounded corners. The edit box is nicer looking than stock TW.</p><p>Felt like I did a fraction of the work today in the office compared to yesterday at home. Guess I did a lot of tiny things and answering various emails - answering emails is such a waste of time. People do need answers but it’s so slow and whilst it feels like accomplishing things, it doesn’t. I need to fully migrate into loqseq and not mostly sit in it but with still some tiddlywiki and even OneNote on the side. Copying and pasting into Loqseq from tiddlywiki wasn’t a pleasant experience. Maybe I have to import files instead, or open them in another editor first. I wondered about going back to tiddlywiki, especially as I found Stroll with its side by side tiddlers. However, the rapid entry of stuff on a day is useful at work. I’m also slowly learning the keyboard shortcuts. </p><p>I think I’m just not very good at using todo systems. I never clean them up, or do the items or process them. Occasionally they act as reminders to do things. I should try and get better at it. The best thing is usually writing a list on paper that morning. </p><p>Keep thinking about a M10. Seems much more exciting to use than the Fuji. But maybe I just lust after it as I don’t have it. The Fuji is very functional and practical. I took some nice pictures of the kids at the beach at the weekend with it. I wonder if I’d get as nice photos with the Leica as it’s manual focus? It would certainly allow for more use of interesting or characterful lenses. I could use them on the film M, but film is limited (ISO and exposures). I do love film but I can’t use it all the time. The M10 is still expensive though. Over 12x what I paid for the X-T2. Maybe I should define myself a savings period. I could just buy it right now, but perhaps if I artificially set aside money for x months and then buy it, it might not that feel as expensive…it’ll still feel expensive. Even over a year it’s £300/month, doesn’t matter how you slice it. Maybe for my next reminder 0 %5 birthday? Still a worry that it’ll not be what I expect it to be, because I’m not a better photographer because of it. However, I’ve take a lot of nice photos with the M2, even of the kids…so it can be done. Just film often forgives more or I forgive it more. Perhaps some Lightroom super noise filters will hide the imperfections.</p><p>I finally setup icloud+ custom email. It’s funny having a new email address. I get about 1 email every 2 days 😅 Versus endlessly trying to spam and unsubscribe from endless things on my gmail. I have a lot of newsletters that I signed up to, but they all seem to come on the same day and I can even get 1-2 weeks behind on reading them. I suppose I can just delete them and move on. </p><p>I want to do a <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/study/postgraduate/brewing-distilling.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">masters in brewing</a>.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>A nice day working at home. Lots of number crunching today which is always satisfying. Even continued into the evening as I was on a roll and didn’t want to have the mental effort of getting back into it tomorrow after going to sleep.</p><p>Blowing a gale today, so a good day to skip cycling to work. Also fixed my rear mudguard, although the screw got stripped when attaching it back to the frame. Next time it works loose I’ll have to find a replacement. Chain and drive train were absolutely filthy, did a half assed job at cleaning it, and then applied some oil. Could do with a chain bath and full scrub down.</p><p>If I wait long enough then I stop wanting to buy things. </p><p>I had thought about getting a new Mac mini with today’s announcement incoming. Although seems it’s the Mac Studio instead, which has great specs, looks…a little odd…but likely overkill and expensive for me. The matching 27” 5K monitor is nice but, again, expensive. I’ve not read all the stuff about them yet so maybe I might be more interested. Although really it’s down the pecking order in terms of new computers to buy. </p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Got a new desk at work, in the refurbed part of the office. The lighting is much nicer, but otherwise it’s the same. I think the desks are closer together and there’s nowhere nearby to hang my coat. There’s various tables and chairs and things in the middle of walkways. They look nice but I can never see myself using them. I also miss 16x10 monitors we used to have, and particularly the 27” monitors I used to have. We had nice new 24” Dells, but they’re small, and 16x9. </p><p>The big boss came and spoke to someone next to me, and then chatted with me. Feel like I always act so weird and not normal when he does. I had just spent all afternoon trying to solve something which was very disheartening as there were so many issues. </p><p>Finished listening to the latest Serial (together with New York Times) podcast. Was good to listen to but ended very nothingy, which I guess just reflects the situation. Picked up my python podcasts, feels like it’s been a while, and then got all excited for making some web apps. I know I’ll not actually do anything…dare I look up when I was talking about learning Javascript. Still on chapter 2 of that book…think if I open preview it’s still there.</p><p>I like doing computer projects but I also like getting away from the computer. I don’t do a very good job at getting away from it, as it’s my habit to go sit on it once the kids go to bed. I’m trying to avoid it now by sitting on my ipad on the sofa but I’m just delaying the inevitable. Learning programming stuff just means spending more time on there. My trousers are reminding me I should be doing some more exercise, and I’d love to buy a rowing machine but I don’t think I’d really use it. Cycling to work isn’t quite enough, and it’s too much hassle to use the gym near work as then it means I have to cycle in with change of clothes and stuff. </p><p>I thought about subscribing to IEEE Spectrum for the magazine, so I’d read interesting topics but away from the computer. But I haven’t yet. </p><p>My rear mud guard has come away from the frame and means I need to remove the rear wheel to secure it again. Ugh.  </p><p>Can’t decide if I like the “Also on today” part of the entries. </p><p>Thinking of getting the Fuji 50mm f/2. The f/1.2 sounds really nice but it's a big boy, and I really like how the 35mm f/2 feels and balances on the camera. </p><p>Think I should increase my pension contribution. I "make" more money by doing that, and in theory means I'll be able to stop work sooner. But I don't like not having the choice, however, if the saving is done for me and I don't get a say then I'll just work round it, and likely my future self will thank my past self. </p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I've spent all last evening and some of today rebuilding my tiddlywiki site (this one). It's remarkably identical to my last one...hmm...it is now running on node.js, vs. just a static hosted Github saver version. So a least I shouldn't get any issues from Github saver any more. I think I'll setup auto git commits to Github and then the action to build it into a static site. </p><p>I'm using a new theme: <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://odinjorna.github.io/zacht-theme/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Zacht</a>. I like most things but not quite everything. So not sure what I'll do about that - probably nothing for a long time. <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://nicolas.petton.fr/tw/notebook.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Notebook</a> was another theme I liked, particularly the centralised search bar and buttons at the top. I just really don't like the left hand sidebar, not because it's on the left but it just looks ugly. However, don't be surprised if you show up and we're running the notebook theme 😂</p><p>I suppose it's like tidying your desk, or slightly rearranging things. Doesn't materially change anything but makes you feel better and gives a new lease of life to get on with something. </p><p>Now I just have to decide what to do with my main site. </p><p>Went to the beach today and took the Fuji X-T2 and 35mm f/2. Do enjoy digital and autofocus! Not sure if it's the lens or the surroundings but I'm liking the classic chrome look again. Perhaps both, together with the bright light that makes it look good. I keep eyeing the X-E4 - partially for size, for Classic neg, and for the last new fuji with a pop out screen that's not articulating. I don't want it out on the side to angle it up or down. Not sure about the grip on it though, although it's a small prime camera really, and you can get a grip add on. I remember looking at the X-T2 when it came out and, compared to my Nikon, I thought the grip was terrible on it. Now I find it perfectly suitable. Not sure I really need to spend £800 on another digital camera though - espeically as it's pretty much the same. The X-T2 isn't exactly massive. </p><p>I did think about taking the M2 today, but I had all the kids so didn't think I'd have capacity for manual camera. Although with good light I could've just had it at f/8 the whole time. However, it's also nice to see the images immediately. Film is also getting really expensive. I know I just talked about buying an £800 camera but colour is pretty much £10 a roll now. Probably going to be just black and white soon enough, and maybe colour for a special occasion, or if some decent sales come along. </p><p>For a long time I've been jpeg "SOOC" with the Fujis. I save RAW but have never used it. Today I did start thinking about processing RAWs, and maybe making some of my own presets for them - to speed up the process. Could be wishful thinking as I don't have lots of free time I sometimes resent spending it faffing about on things like this. Particularly when the only person who notices or cares is me - which is a good reason but not just now.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I still don't love the look of tiddlywiki, and changing it seems complex, or at least more complex than I'm interested in figuring out. Although I did remind myself of the look I made in <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://fondoftea.com/blog/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a> example. The top part looks nice on desktop but just doesn't work on mobile. The problem with tiddlywiki is that I just want to start again, rather than trying to unpack what I previously did. I guess I can just export everything as JSON and do that. Or I tell myself I'll make another blog and then import it all but I get so far and get bored/distracted.</p><p>Then I remember about <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://giffmex.org/stroll/stroll.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stroll</a>.</p><p>I've gone to the bother of making this site but now I'm still not sure it's what I want...</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve gotten completely out of the habit of writing “here” (somewhere online), and that makes me disappointed with myself. </p><p>I’ve also regressed in the evening to sitting in the computer but doing nothing whatsoever. Sort of umming about a new computer but given I just browse the web randomly I have a perfectly suitable computer for that. </p><p>I still have photos to sort out from daughter’s birthday party and film scans that need exif and filing plus any updates to my family photos site. </p><p>Windows really needs reinstalling on my desktop - the amount of weird shit the computer does is getting unbearable. </p><p>Even if I just played a game that would probably be more engaging for me, I’d just started Horizon Zero Dawn at the start of Feb. That looks like a nice story to play through. </p><p>The difficultly with deciding on a new computer is whether or not I need a new graphics card. If I don’t then just cpu, mobo, ram etc upgrade to a 5600X and probably a new case is £500. I’d just keep my current GTX 1060. However if I do want an upgrade the most cost effective way is a prebuilt. £1300 for 5700, and 6800 XT. The 6800 XT from stores is £1100 alone. £500 and wait for 2-3 years for gpu prices to become sensible or £1300 now and &gt;5 years or more before even thinking about an upgrade. </p><p>Also new Mac announcements next week. </p><p>I'll just watch some TV tonight. It doesn't accomplish much but it's better than just faffing around.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Been thinking about getting a new computer. I used to love building computers but now I’m not that interested and have been looking at Lenovo’s desktops as they’re currently good value. Graphic card prices are still eye watering. </p><p>In the old days a medium tier one would be £200 and top would be £400-500. Nowadays a medium one is £500, and that’s RRP - which you’d be lucky to find. This is what makes the Lenovo towers look attractive as the price of them vs price of cpu + gpu components are parity, but you get everything else with the Lenovo. </p><p>I guess I had more free time last time I built my computer…which is now over 10 years ago!</p><p>For a few days I looked at getting a Xbox Series S. I don’t know why. Although Microsoft’s 24 month 0% interest including Game Pass Ultimate is a very clever move. I think a lot of families will use it as it helps manage the cost and you get infinite games with the pass. </p><p>I’ve started doing the Microsoft Rewards points to things. Maybe after 10 years I’ll have enough points to buy an Xbox. </p><p>Not that I play any games or like using a joypad (vs keyboard and mouse). </p><p>New role at work has a lot of things to do and sort out. Been super busy with it. Still using loqseq and liking it, although need to migrate my work TW content into it. </p><p><a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.lcegroup.co.uk/Used/Leica-M10-P-*Boxed*_329496.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Doesn't it look lovely.</a> Another store has a "beat up" (still looks good) M10 for £2700. That's about £800-900 less than the rest. That's the sort of one I should buy.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I need to tidy up my sites. I see my old blog's SSL has expired (which shouldn't happen as it's certbot and crontab...but anyway). </p><p>Think I'll have two blogs - one is this wiki and one is a regular one. The regular one will be Blogging, or at least posts with titles that aren't dates. This wiki is where I'll do random daily chatter....he says confidently...</p>]]>     </description></item>
