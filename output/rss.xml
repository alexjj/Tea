     <description><![CDATA[<p>I have a new computer but it takes the place of the previous one, I have a Nintendo Switch but it and the computer both get used by the kids and so I'm relegated to the 2012 Mac Mini. hmm...I'm running out of screens for more devices though.</p><p>I know what Jack means about having <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://baty.net/2022/feelings-about-the-leica-m10-r/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expensive things</a>. I don't have a camera of equal worth, but any time I've had expensive things - new laptops, new cameras, cars even - they've all caused a certain about of angst. You worry about damaging them or losing them or they get stolen etc. Plus there's the value or worth of it. Always there's something which is cheaper - either used or a different model - which still does the same job. Sometimes there is a quality aspect, or ability/specification or even unique functionality which can't be replicated in cheaper versions, but then the question becomes "Do I <em>really</em> need that?". </p><p>I say all this as I want a M10-P 😅    Also life's short etc...so we'll see.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>I’d forgotten to setup my ipad as a HomeKit base thing after wiping it and reinstalling the OS. I was getting annoyed why stuff wasn’t working and then I realised. Stuff being the one and only smart device I have.</p><p>Boss wanted some slides today for the big boss. I did a terrible job of it and felt dumb when they pointed out the obvious. Makes me want to fix them now but they’ll keep til next week. </p><p>Bored of waiting for the founders edition GPUs to come in stock. Should buy some camera thing instead 😅</p><p>I should do something engaging so I don’t feel like I’m getting more useless and dumber. Possibly it’s too late, or maybe I’m just tired tonight.</p><p>I am too tired, because I stayed up too late watching YouTube videos about cameras.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Went to a conference with work today. Was both fun and unnerving at the same time. Sat there thinking that most likely someone in here has COVID 😅</p><p>Built my new computer last night. With only nvme storage, there feels like there are so few cables in a build these days! It's lovely and shiny and new, although I had to taint it with my old, dusty graphics card until I can find a new one. Installing the CPU cooler is still terrifying.</p><p>Windows installation is very easy these days. Gone of the days needing to get drivers ready on USB drives so that the NIC works, or can display greater than 1280x720 from the graphics card. Windows still tries very hard to get you to log in with a microsoft account vs just a plain computer account. I guess if you were all in on Microsoft it would make it nice. Just like my work laptop I guess, and somewhat similar to Apple.</p><p>If I want Windows 11 I have to turn on Secure Boot in the BIOS, not sure if I want to. Only because I feel like I shouldn't have to. Really I want to run Linux on it, but it's my computer that the whole family uses and things are just generally easier on Windows. Kids want Roblox, wife wants Excel, everyone wants printers to work 😂</p><p>Not sure I'm noticing anything different from the new computer to the old one! More that a fresh install of windows has cleaned up years of crap. So far all I've installed is three browsers, mumble, steam, games from steam, nvidia control panel, roblox, and Disney+ app. Not even setup VS Code or git or anything. Maybe as I'm not in the mood for any of that and would rather use web apps for things. I could do WSL too but think I'd rather setup VS Code server, or use the mac, or something else. It works fine but just ends up being another thing to remember how it's setup.</p><p>I'm hopeful I'll snag a Founders Edition nvidia graphics card for 50% of what current models are selling for in stores. Ideally the notification from the Telegram group comes in whilst I'm at work, on the computer and not busy, and am on my phone there and then! Hopefully the store has Apple Pay express checkout, so I can just hit add, pay and get it! It pinged the other day but it was for German stores. The 3070 Ti was already sold out after 2 minutes!</p><p>Raspberry pi zero 2 did come into stock today, so I ordered one. Been waiting since christmas to get one to go with my e-ink display I got for christmas. The zero 2 doesn't have the GPIO pins, so I ordered them but that means I need to solder them and my only soldering iron was a US one and therefore won't work here...so I should buy one of those too. Seems excessive just to add the pins but I guess a soldering iron is a useful tool to have around. Need to find a microSD card, I think I have a spare one somewhere...</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Unsurprisingly Nintendo came back with "this department can't help you. Please submit another support ticket". The department suggested in the last email didn't exist as a drop-down...3 times the charm...I hope.</p><p>Several M10-Ps I was looking at are actually on sale, and much cheaper than I originally though...oh dear...</p><p>At a much smaller scale, I bought Mass Effect Legendary edition as it's 55% off in Steam sale. I used to own ME1 and 2 but never played them. I think they were the last games I bought on CD/DVD before everything was Steam downloads. The legendary edition includes all three games, all the DLCs, graphics upgrades and bug fixes and all sorts. A friend has played it recently and said it was exceptionally good. Given I've never played the series before, and it's supposed to be one of the great computer game story series, I'm looking forward to it. All in all good value for £20. </p><p>This site, and several before this, were all originally made for me to ‘improve myself’. Writing things down, reflect upon them, change for the better. Etc. I guess I’ve done, or partially done, step 1. Possibly the things I have written down aren’t material that one can use to improve. Endless prattling about buying things no-one really needs? Not that I’m expecting to write groundbreaking original thought. </p><p>Ultimately though, nothing that I do or don’t do matters in the grand scheme of the universe. I should undertake my daily obligations to family and friends in a way that I’d like them to do to me. I should be content, there is always more. </p><p>I should read something that’s a bit more thoughtful rather than my epic fantasy books. </p><p>Sometimes I feel like I’ve regressed. I’m not achieving new things, or learning new skills or creating new content. I’m playing computer games. But is that really bad? Does it really matter? Sometimes I think no, sometimes I think yes. There are always people to compare to who do more, and people who do less - both may be content or both may be unhappy. These things are too deep to think about.

     <description><![CDATA[<p>That M10P sold, and now it seems like it was a much better deal that I thought. However, it’s considerably more expensive than anything I’ve bought before so my ability to actually buy it is still very low! </p><p>Time to play some Black Mesa instead. I can’t remember anything from playing Half-Life 1 originally so it’s like a new game. The graphics are much better than the original too so that helps. Although in my head this is what the graphics were like…even though they’re much better. It was similar when watching Diablo 2 resurrected videos. They’ve enhanced the graphics but in my head that’s what they used to look like - and then they show you the original, oh yes, they were really that bad! However, that is a game I definitely don’t have time for.</p><p>I lost my code for Mario Kart 8 DLC. So mostly my fault, I guess I deleted the email..?.. and now it’s been more than 30 days so Gmail has deleted it. However, the fact that the Nintendo Store has no purchase history, nor the ability to directly apply a game code to the account you just purchased it with, AND when you purchase a game code you have to wait until one week before its release before you can apply it…? Why? Nintendo make some great games but they seem to suck at basic account stuff or online play or the whole ecosystem. So I emailed support, who closed the ticket saying I should contact the “My Nintendo store” rather than Nintendo Support. Obviously. Except they provide a link, which has a submit a message box, which goes to…Nintendo Support. Tried some different drop downs to see if it goes to the right place. I got a please provide feedback on our customer support after today’s closed ticket. Needless to say I scored them very poorly. Okay I understand Nintendo has multiple departments and different people work on different things but come on, support should redirect to the right place. Nintendo is one company. I won’t be surprised when they finally tell me that “they have no ability to resend the code and I have to buy it again”. Hopefully I’ll be proved wrong. Unfortunately I probably will buy it again if it comes to it, as everyone in the house loves Mario Kart and new tracks would be fun. I’ll be sure to buy it from some “dodgy” keys website…who allow you to access your key online and have a record of transactions in your account…</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>You can call me Al
</p><cite>Paul Simon</cite></blockquote><p>What is this song about? 😵‍💫</p><p>Most of the new computer parts have arrived. Just waiting on the CPU, which should hopefully come next couple of days. I've got some old Windows keys from previous laptops. I wonder if any of them will activate Windows 10...If none of them do, then do I transfer my existing computer's key or buy another? Really don't want to buy Windows. I can't even remember the last time I did. Perhaps Windows 7? Think I got that from student discount at university. I guess I can install Linux on the old computer...although not sure what that's going to be used for. Supposedly saved for the kids but they're not going to want to play on it for several years I think, and there's nowhere for it to go at the moment. Apart from the graphics card, it's worthless though, so might as well keep it for spare. Even if it just sits in the loft for a while. </p><p>I've one solitary colour film, Fujicolor 100, from about 2 weeks ago waiting to be developed. Maybe I should just send it off on its own. </p><p>That M10-P I was debating about has gone from eBay. I think the seller cancelled the listing as eBay says it was taken down due to an error, perhaps he realised it was significantly cheaper than all the other listings? I was close to getting it....well I tell myself that now as the listing is gone and no-one can prove me wrong. I did message the seller just in case. However, I should take it as a sign that I do not need to buy a Leica digital camera. Probably in 10+ years time should I then get one. </p><p>...or that a <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#Leica%20M10">M10</a> is just fine...</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>After seeing an offer on a 5600X, it turned into buying a whole new computer! 😅  The hardest part is deciding on getting a new graphics card (or not). My current one, RTX 1060, isn't shabby, plus pricing is insane right now. The best option is getting a founder's edition - which for some reason is sold at RRP - but there's only one store that sells them and they only get a few in stock every couple of weeks. </p><p>I did fret about the motherboard that I bought. Probably best not reading reviews, as generally people only leave reviews if things don't work, and there are likely hundreds which are perfectly fine. Similarly with buying a PSU, there are so many options, it's best not to get bogged down into the details and just pick a known brand at a reasonable price point.</p><p>It should all be arriving over the next few days, so I'll be having fun building ... it'll be my first build in just over 10 years! </p><p>I sort of want to install Linux, but given everyone else in the house uses it, I'll probably start with Windows, may even go to 11. </p><p>Installed Wordpress to blog.alexjj.com. Haven't done anything with it yet, and not sure if I want to but the ease of it appeals to me. I think it'll help me write more...? It does make me nervous about databases and things and not having the material in plain-ish text. I suppose there's backup methods and things.</p><p>Also been thinking about having a semi-crazy landing page, just because why not. I used to have this <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://alexjj.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one</a>.</p>]]>     </description></item>

     <description><![CDATA[<p>Now <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021210080822/http://textism.com:80/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this is how you write an about page</a>.</p><p>I’m enjoying writing back in the wiki. I do occasionally look at my other site and admire the aesthetics, but this theme has helped me enjoy the look of it again. Must be the rounded corners. The edit box is nicer looking than stock TW.</p><p>Felt like I did a fraction of the work today in the office compared to yesterday at home. Guess I did a lot of tiny things and answering various emails - answering emails is such a waste of time. People do need answers but it’s so slow and whilst it feels like accomplishing things, it doesn’t. I need to fully migrate into loqseq and not mostly sit in it but with still some tiddlywiki and even OneNote on the side. Copying and pasting into Loqseq from tiddlywiki wasn’t a pleasant experience. Maybe I have to import files instead, or open them in another editor first. I wondered about going back to tiddlywiki, especially as I found Stroll with its side by side tiddlers. However, the rapid entry of stuff on a day is useful at work. I’m also slowly learning the keyboard shortcuts. </p><p>I think I’m just not very good at using todo systems. I never clean them up, or do the items or process them. Occasionally they act as reminders to do things. I should try and get better at it. The best thing is usually writing a list on paper that morning. </p><p>Keep thinking about a M10. Seems much more exciting to use than the Fuji. But maybe I just lust after it as I don’t have it. The Fuji is very functional and practical. I took some nice pictures of the kids at the beach at the weekend with it. I wonder if I’d get as nice photos with the Leica as it’s manual focus? It would certainly allow for more use of interesting or characterful lenses. I could use them on the film M, but film is limited (ISO and exposures). I do love film but I can’t use it all the time. The M10 is still expensive though. Over 12x what I paid for the X-T2. Maybe I should define myself a savings period. I could just buy it right now, but perhaps if I artificially set aside money for x months and then buy it, it might not that feel as expensive…it’ll still feel expensive. Even over a year it’s £300/month, doesn’t matter how you slice it. Maybe for my next reminder 0 %5 birthday? Still a worry that it’ll not be what I expect it to be, because I’m not a better photographer because of it. However, I’ve take a lot of nice photos with the M2, even of the kids…so it can be done. Just film often forgives more or I forgive it more. Perhaps some Lightroom super noise filters will hide the imperfections.</p><p>I finally setup icloud+ custom email. It’s funny having a new email address. I get about 1 email every 2 days 😅 Versus endlessly trying to spam and unsubscribe from endless things on my gmail. I have a lot of newsletters that I signed up to, but they all seem to come on the same day and I can even get 1-2 weeks behind on reading them. I suppose I can just delete them and move on. </p><p>I want to do a <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/uk/study/postgraduate/brewing-distilling.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">masters in brewing</a>.
